# Online appendix {.unnumbered}

## Attach R session info in appendix {#sec-rsessioninfo}

Since R and R packages are constantly evolving you might want to add the R session info that contains information on the R version as well as the packages that are loaded.

```{r echo=FALSE}
print(sessionInfo(), local = FALSE)
```

## All the code in the paper

To simply attach all the code you used in the PDF file in the appendix see the R chunk in the underlying `.qmd` file:

```{r, ref.label=knitr::all_labels(),echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
```
