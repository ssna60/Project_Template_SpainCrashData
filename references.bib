   abstract = {Wrong-way driving (WWD) has been a constant traffic safety problem in certain types of roads. These crashes are mostly associated with fatal or severe injuries. This study aims to determine associations between various factors in the WWD crashes. Past studies on WWD crashes used either descriptive statistics or logistic regression to identify the impact of key contributing factors on frequency and/or severity of crashes. Machine learning and data mining approaches are resourceful in determining interesting and non-trivial patterns from complex datasets. This study employed association rules ‘Eclat’ algorithm to determine the interactions between different factors that result in WWD crashes. This study analyzed five years (2010–2014) of Louisiana WWD crash data to perform the analysis. A broad definition of WWD crashes (both freeway exit ramp WWD crashes and median crossover WWD crashes on low speed roadways) was used in this study. The results of this study confirmed that WWD fatalities are more likely to be associated with head-on collisions. Additionally, fatal WWD crashes tend to be involved with male drivers and off-peak hours. Driver impairment was found as a critical factor among the top twenty rules. Despite several other studies identifying only the WWD contributing factors, this study determined several influencing patterns in WWD crashes. The findings can provide an excellent opportunity for state departments of transportation (DOTs) and local agencies to develop safety strategies and engineering solutions to tackle the issues associated with WWD crashes.},

This research investigates the impact of 16 roadway condition features and vacations (along with the spatial and temporal factors and road geometry) on crash severity for major intra-city roads in Saudi Arabia. We used a crash dataset that covers four years (Oct. 2016–Feb. 2021) with more than 59,000 crashes. Machine learning algorithms were utilized to predict the crash severity outcome (non-fatal/fatal) for three types of roads: single, multilane, and freeway. Furthermore, features that have a strong impact on crash severity were examined. Results show that only 4 out of 16 road condition variables were found to be contributing to crash severity, namely: paints, cat eyes, fence side, and metal cable. Additionally, vacation was found to be a contributing factor to crash severity, meaning crashes that occur on vacation are more severe than non-vacation days.},

   abstract = {The estimation of the effect of contributors to crash injury severity and the prediction of crash injury severity outcomes suffer often from biases related to missing data in crash datasets that contain incomplete records. As both estimation and prediction would greatly improve if the missing values were recovered, this study proposes a sequential approach to handle incomplete crash datasets and rank contributors to the injury severity of crashes on mountainous freeways in China. The sequential approach consists of two parts: (i) multivariate imputation by chained equations imputes the missing values of independent variables; (ii) a random forest classifier analyses the correlation between the dependent and the independent variables. The first part considers different imputation methods in light of the independent variables being either binary, categorical or continuous, whereas the second part classifies the correlations according to the random forest classifier. The proposed method was applied to the case-study about mountainous freeways in China and compared to the analysis of the raw dataset to evaluate its effectiveness, and the results illustrate that the method improves significantly the classification accuracy when compared with existing methods. Moreover, the classifier ranked the contributors to the injury severity of traffic crashes on mountainous freeways: in order of importance vehicle type, crash type, road longitudinal gradient, crash cause, curve radius, and deflection angles. Interestingly, a lower importance was found for environmental factors.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a machine learning approach, the random survival forest (RSF) for competing risks, to investigate highway-rail grade crossing (HRGC) crash severity during a 29-year analysis period. The benefits of the RSF approach are that it (1) is a special type of survival analysis able to accommodate the competing nature of multiple-event outcomes to the same event of interest (here the competing multiple events are crash severities), (2) is able to conduct an event-specific selection of risk factors, (3) has the capability to determine long-term cumulative effects of contributors with the cumulative incidence function (CIF), (4) provides high prediction performance, and (5) is effective in high-dimensional settings. The RSF approach is able to consider complexities in HRGC safety analysis, e.g., non-linear relationships between HRGCs crash severities and the contributing factors and heterogeneity in data. Variable importance (VIMP) technique is adopted in this research for selecting the most predictive contributors for each crash-severity level. Moreover, marginal effect analysis results real several HRGC countermeasures’ effectiveness. Several insightful findings are discovered. For examples, adding stop signs to HRGCs that already have a combination of gate, standard flashing lights, and audible devices will reduce the likelihood of property damage only (PDO) crashes for up to seven years; but after the seventh year, the crossings are more likely to have PDO crashes. Adding audible devices to crossing with gates and standard flashing lights will reduce crash likelihood, PDO, injury, and fatal crashes by 49 %, 52 %, 46 %, and 50 %, respectively.},

We use various machine learning models, including support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to analyze the crash severity. Besides, we apply the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret the importance of each factor. The results indicate that XGBoost obtains the best result (recall = 75%; G-mean = 67.82%). Both XGBoost and Apriori algorithm effectively provided meaningful insights about AV-involved crash characteristics and their relationship. Among all these features, vehicle damage, weather conditions, accident location, and driving mode are the most critical features. We found that most rear-end crashes are conventional vehicles bumping into the rear of AVs. Drivers should be extremely cautious when driving in fog, snow, and insufficient light. Besides, drivers should be careful when driving near intersections, especially in the autonomous driving mode.},

   abstract = {Access to non-biased and accurate models capable of predicting driver injury severity of collision events is vital for determining what safety measures should be implemented at intersections. Inadequate models can underestimate the potential for collision events to result in driver fatalities or injuries, which can lead to improperly assessing the safety criteria of an intersection. This study investigates how injury severity differs between drivers of various ages and gender groups using cost-sensitive data-mining models. Previous research efforts have used machine learning methods for predicting injury severity; however, these studies did not consider the consequences (cost) of incorrect predictions. This paper addresses this shortfall by considering the monetary cost of incorrect injury severity predictions when developing C4.5, instance-based (IB), and random forest (RF) machine-learning models. One model of each method was developed for four distinct cohorts of drivers (i.e., younger males, younger females, older males, and older females). Each model considered a selection of driver, vehicular, road/traffic, environmental, and crash parameters for determining if they significantly influenced driver injury severity. A five-year period of two-vehicle crash data collected at signalized intersections in the metropolitan area of Miami, Florida was used in the models. Results indicated that cost-sensitive learning classifiers were superior to regular classifiers at accurately predicting injuries and fatalities of crashes. Among cost-sensitive models, RF outperformed C4.5 and IB models in predicting driver injury severity for four groups of drivers. The models displayed substantial differences in injury severity determinants across the age/gender cohorts.},

   abstract = {The use of machine learning techniques in safety research has increased as has the interest in using new data sources. This study's unique contribution is the application of text mining—focusing on perceived cyclist safety and crash occurrence in an urban environment. We analysed crash data collected by the emergency forces in the Capital Region of Denmark from 2013 to 2017 and self-reported textual data provided by cyclists from 2018 to 2019. The analysis included natural language processing and topic modelling to identify Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topics from self-reports, representing environment characteristics that cyclists’ perceive as unsafe. A multi-output neural network regression model is applied to predict the injury-severity distribution of cyclists involved in crashes (measured by emergency response level [ERL]) based on the obtained topic distributions together with additional variables like cycle flow. We identified six LDA topics which address buses and cycle paths, conflicts with parked cars, roundabouts and inadequate maintenance, fast-moving cars and lack of cycle path, school zones and heavy traffic, and intersections and interactions with vehicles. Cycle flow was found to be the highest impacter on ERL prediction. However, other factors also impacted ERLs, especially school zones and heavy traffic. The results bring new insights into safety perception and actual safety for cyclists. The results contribute to a novel procedure for the joint correlation analysis using machine learning techniques on self-reported textual data thereby providing a better tool for infrastructure planning. The findings show the importance of including perceived safety in crash modelling and that authorities should focus on safety around schools and in intersections in order to improve safety for cyclists in a urban environment.},

For vulnerable road users like pedestrians and bicyclists, this issue is more gruesome. We present an analysis of the effect of crash, geometric, and environmental characteristics on the bicycle-involved hit and run crashes by using six years of Louisiana crash data with an application of fast and frugal tree (FFT) heuristics algorithm. Over 1000 bicycle-involved hit and run crashes occurred in Louisiana out of around 108,000 hit and run crashes during 2010–2015. The fatal bicycle crashes represent 10% of the total fatal hit and run crashes. Additionally, hit and run bicycle crashes represent 22% of total bicycle crashes in Louisiana. In the preliminary analysis, we provided statistical significance test of the key contributing factors for two major groups (bicycle-involved hit and run crashes, and not bicycle-involved hit and run crashes). We divided the complete dataset into two separate datasets: training data for model development, and testing data for performance evaluation. FFT identifies five major cues or variable threshold attributes that contribute significantly in predicting bicycle-involved crashes. These cues include fatal and injury crashes, right angle/turning/head on collisions, city streets/others, intersection, and residential/mixed localities. The balanced accuracy is around 76% for both training and testing data. The current model shows higher sensitivity than other complex and black box machine learning models (e.g., support vector machine, random forest). Findings of our study will provide valuable insights for hit and run bicycle crash reduction in both planning and operation levels.},

An important portion of vehicle–pedestrian crashes occurred at intersections due to the complex movements of various types of road users and the conflicts among them. To address the safety concern, this paper investigates the contributing factors to the severity of vehicle–pedestrian crashes at intersections based on a 3-year crash dataset of Hong Kong. For the crash severity modelling process, the crash dataset is mass and complicated. To tackle the class imbalance issue of the crash severity level, data resampling method is firstly applied. Then, various data mining algorithms, namely, classification and regression tree (CART) model, gradient boosting (GB) model, random forest (RF) model, artificial neural network (ANN) model and support vector machine (SVM) model, have been applied. The performance of these models have also been compared with the logistic regression model commonly applied in the literature. The ANN model which has the best performance is selected to determine the most significant contributing factors to the fatal and severe crashes, and the marginal effects of these factors are also analysed. Results show that the likelihood of fatal and severe vehicle–pedestrian crashes at intersections increase when there is light rain and where the junction control type is traffic signal and no control. On the other hand, the crash severity tends to decrease when the weather condition is clear, the light condition is daylight and dark, and in the districts of Kwun Tong, Kowloon City, Central and Western, and Sham Shui Po. Based on the results, policy implications and counter-measures on reducing the fatal and severe vehicle–pedestrian crashes at intersections have been recommended.},

The study involved the investigation of the influence of a set of intersection, drivers, environmental, and crash characteristics on crash injury severity. The results demonstrated urban and signalized intersections were related to lower severity levels. In addition, higher pavement friction is more likely to be associated with less severe crashes. Crashes that involved drivers who are females or impaired and crashes on weekends were associated with higher severity levels.

In this study we evaluated application of hybrid support vector machine (SVM) and hyperparameter optimization models for improved accuracy of crash severity prediction. Two hybrid models were evaluated: a genetic algorithm-optimized SVM (GA-SVM) and greedy-search optimized SVM (GS-SVM) models. The dataset used in model development and testing contained 12,198 work-zone crash observations in New Jersey over three years, from 2016 to 2018. The results indicate that the GA-SVM model outperformed both GS-SVM and the SVM with default parameters in predicting the severity of work zone crashes. While GA-SVM provided the best accuracy, it had the highest computation time. Among more than dozen factors considered in the models, the findings suggest that crash type and posted speed limit were the most significant for estimation or prediction of work-zone crash severity. The modeling approach and methods demonstrated in this study can improve the accuracy of crash prediction models. Also, a two-stage sensitivity analysis was conducted to see the impact of associated factors based on the probability of crash severity in work zones. The key findings revealed that early morning, nighttime, rainy environmental condition, rear-end crashes, a roadway with no median, and a higher posted speed limit increased the likelihood of injury and fatality in the work zone areas. This improvement will in turn lead to better informed decisions about planning and implementing work zone safety enhancements aimed at reducing severity of crashes.},

Random parameters logit models with heterogeneity in the means and variances are utilized to identify significant factors, explore unobserved heterogeneity, reveal correlations between factors, and suggest possible impacts of economic conditions on the factors. Different likelihood ratio tests indicate that the effects of factors vary significantly across time-of-day and economic-related cycle periods. Significant time-of-day variations imply more severe injury alcohol/drug involved crashes during the nighttime compared to the daytime. Meanwhile, temporal instabilities are also observed in marginal effects of several factors across three-cycle periods. Proficient and cautious elder drivers were safer than young drivers during the depression period. Also, both depressing and expanding periods could affect the involvement of alcohol/drugs for drivers. Shifts in alcohol/drug use behaviors underscore the importance of accounting time-of-day variations, temporal instabilities, and heterogeneity in the means and variances inherent in alcohol/drug-impaired crash factors after the Great Recession. The insights of this study should be valuable to improve specific enforcements, qualify punishments, organize targeted campaigns, and design other preventive activities for alcohol/drug-impaired crashes.},

Considerable research efforts are needed to understand better significant causal factors for alcohol-related crash risks and driver’s injury severities in order to develop effective countermeasures and proper policies for system-wide traffic safety performance improvements. Furthermore, since two thirds of urban Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is on signal-controlled roadways, it is of practical importance to investigate injury severities of all drivers who are involved in intersection-related crashes and their corresponding significant causal factors due to control and geometric impacts on flow progression interruptions. This study aims to identify and quantify the impacts of alcohol/non-alcohol-influenced driver’s behavior and demographic features as well as geometric and environmental characteristics on driver’s injury severities around intersections in New Mexico. The econometric models, multinomial Logit models, were developed to analyze injury severities for regular sober drivers and alcohol-influenced drivers, respectively, using the crash data collected in New Mexico from 2010 to 2011. Elasticity analyzes were conducted in order to understand better the quantitative impacts of these contributing factors on driver’s injury outcomes. The research findings provide a better understanding of contributing factors and their impacts on driver injury severities in crashes around intersections. For example, the probability of having severe injuries is higher for non-alcohol-influenced drivers when the drivers are 65 years old or older. Drivers’ left-turning action will increase non-alcohol-influenced driver injury severities in crash occurring around intersections. However, different characteristics are captured for alcohol-influenced drivers involved in intersection-related crashes. For example, more severe injuries of alcohol-influenced drivers can be observed around intersections with three or more lanes on each approach. The model specifications and estimation results are also helpful for transportation agencies and decision makers to develop cost-effective solutions to reduce alcohol-involved crash severities and improve traffic system safety performance.},

   abstract = {Objective: Alcohol-involved drivers or those with blood alcohol concentrations greater than 0.00 percent have more frequent and more severe crashes than other drivers. Alcohol use, because it delays perception and response and impairs coordination, increases the risk of a crash. However, those using alcohol may take additional driving risks, which may also lead to crashes. This study was done to learn whether risks besides alcohol involvement contributed to crash initiation and whether crash severity increased with alcohol involvement or with those other risky behaviors. Methods: Data that represented nearly 1.4 million motor vehicle crashes were accessed from an NHTSA database. Analyses evaluated whether alcohol-involved driving was associated with other driving risks and whether driver alcohol involvement, alone or together with other risks, increased the likelihood of initiating a 2-vehicle crash or in the event of a crash or increased crash severity. Results: Alcohol-involved drivers were less likely to use seat belts, drove faster, and were more likely to be distracted than others. Those who initiated 2-vehicle crashes were more likely to be alcohol involved or to have taken other driving risks than others from the same crashes. Crash severity was significantly greater for alcohol-involved drivers than for other drivers, but severity increased further if additional risks were taken. Crashes involving only drivers who had not used alcohol were also sometimes severe, and that severity was associated with risky driving behaviors. When crashes involved 2 drivers, the behaviors of both affected crash severity. Conclusions: Risky driving behaviors, including alcohol involvement, increased the risk of a crash. Crash severity tended to increase with any risky behavior and to increase further with multiple risky behaviors. Other risky behaviors were associated with both alcohol involvement and crashes. Therefore, if effects from those other risky behaviors were not accommodated for, those effects would confound apparent associations between alcohol involvement and crashes. Therefore, this study's use of multivariate models that accommodated for effects from those other behaviors provided a truer picture of alcohol's association with crashes than simpler models would have.

   abstract = {Introduction: The dominant cause of injuries in traffic crashes. A significant portion of them affects victims under the influence of ethyl alcohol. The goal of the studies was to assess the correlation between the state of sobriety and the severity of injuries expressed by injury severity scales in fatal pedestrian victims of traffic crashes. Research Material and Method: The data were obtained from the Warsaw Medical University's Department of Forensic Medicine. The analysis covered the data for 2009–2013 and included 200 fatal pedestrian victims hit by passenger cars. The assessment of the effect of risk factors on injury severity expressed in terms of injury severity scales such as Life Threat Indicator (LTI), International Classification based Injury Severity Score (ICISS), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and New Injury Severity Score (NISS), was made using adequately selected methods of statistical analysis. Results: As alcohol concentration increases in women, the values of LTI, ICISS-10 and ICISS-15 decrease, which denotes more severe injuries. In the ISS and NISS, the effect of alcohol concentration on the severity of injuries turned out to be negligible. However, these injuries are significantly heavier in women than in men. According to all the scales used, the older the victims, the milder injuries cause their death. Conclusions: The studies show that ethyl alcohol concentration may harm injury severity, especially in the case of women. The assessment of the severity of injuries in traffic crash victims is significantly influenced by their age and gender. The more risk factors the scale takes into consideration, the more precise is the assessment.},

   abstract = {Objective: The objective of this research is to identify and compare contributing factors to head-on crashes with drivers under and not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Methods: The head-on crash data are collected from 2005 to 2013 in North Carolina from four aspects: vehicle, driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics. The final dataset includes 9,153 head-on crashes. A mixed logit model is developed to analyze the crash dataset involving drivers under and not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Results: According to the obtained results, factors such as rural roadways, adverse weather, curve road, and high speed limit are among the most significant contributing factors to both head-on crashes with DUI and non-DUI. In addition, the results of this research demonstrate that high speed limit is found to be better modeled as random-parameters at specific injury severity levels for head-on crashes with DUI. Besides the factors mentioned above, dark light condition, old drivers, pickups, and motorcycles also significantly affect the severity of head-on crashes with non-DUI. Conclusions: The results of this study identify various factors that significantly affect the severity of head-on crashes with drivers under and not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Also, the mixed logit model examines the heterogeneous effects and correlation in unobserved factors by allowing coefficients to be randomly distributed. The findings of this study call for more attention to head-on crashes and provide a reference for planners and engineers when developing and selecting countermeasures to reduce and/or mitigate head-on crashes.},

Logit estimates indicate that crashes in which the at-fault drivers had been drinking are more likely to result in a severe injury or death than are crashes caused by sober drivers. Ordered logit estimates indicate that at-fault driver alcohol use increases the expected highest degree of injury resulting from a crash, and Tobit estimates indicate that the number of injuries or deaths per crash increase an average of 0.71 when the at-fault driver has been drinking. Moreover, at-fault driver alcohol use worsens the severity of crashes relative to not-at-fault parties.

   abstract = {Objective: It is well known that alcohol and drugs influence driving behavior by affecting the central nervous system, awareness, vision, and perception/reaction times, but the resulting effect on driver injuries in car crashes is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to identify factors affecting the injury severities of unimpaired, alcohol-impaired, and drug-impaired drivers. Method: The current article applies a random parameters logit model to study the differences in injury severities among unimpaired, alcohol-impaired, and drug-impaired drivers. Using data from single-vehicle crashes in Cook County, Illinois, over a 9-year period from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2012, separate models for unimpaired, alcohol-impaired, and drug-impaired drivers were estimated. A wide range of variables potentially affecting driver injury severity was considered, including roadway and environmental conditions, driver attributes, time and location of the crash, and crash-specific factors. Results: The estimation results show significant differences in the determinants of driver injury severities across groups of unimpaired, alcohol-impaired, and drug-impaired drivers. The findings also show that unimpaired drivers are understandably more responsive to variations in lighting, adverse weather, and road conditions, but these drivers also tend to have much more heterogeneity in their behavioral responses to these conditions, relative to impaired drivers. In addition, age and gender were found to be important determinants of injury severity, but the effects varied significantly across all drivers, particularly among alcohol-impaired drivers. Conclusions: The model estimation results show that statistically significant differences exist in driver injury severities among the unimpaired, alcohol-impaired, and drug-impaired driver groups considered. Specifically, we find that unimpaired drivers tend to have more heterogeneity in their injury outcomes in the presence potentially adverse weather and road surface conditions. This makes sense because one would expect unimpaired drivers to apply their full knowledge/judgment range to deal with these conditions, and the variability of this range across the driver population (with different driving experiences, etc.) should be great. In contrast, we find, for the most part, that alcohol-impaired and drug-impaired drivers have far less heterogeneity in the factors that affect injury severity, suggesting an equalizing effect resulting from the decision-impairing substance.},

   abstract = {The current study contributes to the existing injury severity modeling literature by developing a multivariate probit model of injury severity and seat belt use decisions of both drivers involved in two-vehicle crashes. The modeling approach enables the joint modeling of the injury severity of multiple individuals involved in a crash, while also recognizing the endogeneity of seat belt use in predicting injury severity levels as well as accommodating unobserved heterogeneity in the effects of variables. The proposed model is applied to analyze the injury severity of drivers involved in two-vehicle road crashes in Denmark. The empirical analysis provides strong support for the notion that people offset the restraint benefits of seat belt use by driving more aggressively. Also, men and those individuals driving heavy vehicles have a lower injury risk than women and those driving lighter vehicles, respectively. At the same time, men and individuals driving heavy vehicles pose more of a danger to other drivers on the roadway when involved in a crash. Other important determinants of injury severity include speed limit on roadways where crash occurs, the presence (or absence) of center dividers (median barriers), and whether the crash involves a head-on collision. These and other results are discussed, along with implications for countermeasures to reduce injury severities in crashes. The analysis also underscores the importance of considering injury severity at a crash level, while accommodating seat belt endogeneity effects and unobserved heterogeneity effects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to measure the preventive effect of seat belt on traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to compare the effect according to the crash severities and collision directions. Methods: Korea In-Depth Accident Study (KIDAS) has collected vehicle and demographic data on injured occupants involved in motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) who visited three emergency medical centers for calendar years 2011–2016. Primary and secondary end points were TBI (abbreviated injury score 2+) and in-hospital mortality. Crush extent (CE) was classified into 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, and 7–9 according to the crash severity. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of seat belts and CE for study outcomes and developed an interaction model in each collision direction using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the 2,245 occupants who were injured in MVCs, 295 (13.1%) occupants sustained TBI. In univariate analysis, old age, unbelted status, lateral collision, and higher CE were factors associated with TBI in MVCs. Occupants with belted status was less likely to have TBI and in-hospital mortality compared with those with unbelted status [AORs (95% CI) 0.48 (0.37–0.62) and 0.49 (0.30–0.81), respectively]. In interaction analysis, preventive effects of seat belts on TBI from MVCs were retained within CE 5–6 in frontal MVCs and within CE 1–2 in near side lateral MVCs, and those of seat belts on in-hospital mortality were reserved within CE 3–4 in frontal and rollover MVCs. Conclusions: The preventive effects of seat belts on TBI and in-hospital mortality are preserved within a limited crash severity in each collision direction.},

   abstract = {A review of US mortality crashes revealed that motorcycle crashes are overrepresented in fatal crashes in the United States. Unlike passenger vehicles, motorcycles do not have much protection when it comes to crash involvement. In Wyoming, fatal or severe crashes account for 4% of all crashes, while 34% of motorcycle crashes are fatal or severe. Despite the heightened severity of motorcycle crashes, not much research has been conducted by using comprehensive methods to identify the contributory factors of such crashes. Furthermore, often the previous studies conducted analyses without evaluation of prediction accuracy of the models. Thus, this study evaluated the possibility of using both parametric and nonparametric methods in prediction of motorcycle at-fault injury severity. The goodness of the fit for the included methods was evaluated by comparing the performance of the models. Emphasis is given to mountainous highways where motorcycle use is high along with high crash incidence rates. Binary logistic regression as a parametric method, and the classification tree (CT) as a nonparametric method were employed in this study. Before conducting the analyses, an optimum set of included predictors was identified based on feature reduction. Also, in order to address the biased associated with selection of the test data, k-fold cross validation was used. The binary logistic regression has been used to analyze injury severity. However, this model relies on some very specific assumptions regarding the probability distribution, and logit link function. An alternative to binary logistic could be the classification tree (CT) which predicts injury severity based upon the set of predictors. The results indicated that although both models provided a comparable error rate binary logistic perform slightly better in prediction of motorcycle at-fault injury severity. The models performed similarly in terms of identified predictors. Some of the predictors that identified similarly with the two methods are posted speed limit, age, Highway functional class, and speed compliance.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Reducing the severity of crashes is a top priority for safety researchers due to its impact on saving human lives. Because of safety concerns posed by large trucks and the high rate of fatal large truck-involved crashes, an exploration into large truck-involved crashes could help determine factors that are influential in crash severity. The current study focuses on large truck-involved crashes to predict influencing factors on crash injury severity. Method: Two techniques have been utilized: Random Parameter Binary Logit (RPBL) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Models have been developed to estimate: (1) multivehicle (MV) truck-involved crashes, in which large truck drivers are at fault, (2) MV track-involved crashes, in which large truck drivers are not at fault and (3) and single-vehicle (SV) large truck crashes. Results: Fatigue and deviation to the left were found as the most important contributing factors that lead to fatal crashes when the large truck-driver is at fault. Outcomes show that there are differences among significant factors between RPBL and SVM. For instance, unsafe lane-changing was significant in all three categories in RPBL, but only SV large truck crashes in SVM. Conclusions: The outcomes showed the importance of the complementary approaches to incorporate both parametric RPBL and non-parametric SVM to identify the main contributing factors affecting the severity of large truck-involved crashes. Also, the results highlighted the importance of categorization based on the at-fault party. Practical Applications: Unrealistic schedules and expectations of trucking companies can cause excessive stress for the large truck drivers, which could leads to further neglect of their fatigue. Enacting and enforcing comprehensive regulations regarding large truck drivers’ working schedules and direct and constant surveillance by authorities would significantly decrease large truck-involved crashes.},

   abstract = {Rear-end crashes are a relatively common crash type and often occur at or near intersections. Although rear-end crashes are generally less severe than some other crash types, there were still 2,346 fatal and 595,000 injury rear-end crashes in the US in 2019 alone. These crashes are generally caused by one at-fault driver who strikes a leading vehicle, and it may be useful to assess factors associated with a driver being at-fault. Additionally, it is important to analyze factors associated with injury severity outcomes in order to develop countermeasures aimed at preventing severe injuries. As such, this study investigates factors related to fault status and injury severity (and the interrelation between the two) in two-vehicle intersection-related rear-end crashes using data from a southwestern US state. A binary probit model was estimated to assess factors associated with fault status, while a bivariate ordered probit model was estimated to assess factors associated with driver injury severity by fault status. Importantly, by modelling the injury severity of both crash-involved drivers jointly, potential within-crash correlation can be accounted for. The results of the fault status model indicated numerous factors were associated with a fault status including vehicle type, driver age, and driver impairment or distraction. The results of the bivariate injury severity model indicated numerous factors were significantly associated with injury severity and importantly, differences were observed between at-fault and not-at-fault drivers. Ultimately, the results of this study may assist in development of targeted countermeasures aimed at reducing both crash occurrence and severe injury outcomes.},

In contrast to earlier research that has focused on young and old drivers, age is considered here on its lifetime continuum. A logit model is adopted and the gender and age of the at-fault drivers are part of the independent explanatory variables. The unit of analysis is the individual crash. Since age is a continuous variable, this analysis shows more precisely how age impacts accident severity and identifies when age has little effect. According to the results, the type of vehicle, timing of the crash, type of road and intersection, road condition, regional and locational factors, and socio-economic characteristic have a significant impact on crashes. Regarding the effect of age, when an accident occurs the probability of bodily injury or fatality is 0.703 for female drivers, and 0.718 for male drivers at 15 years of age. These probabilities decline very slightly to 0.696 and 0.711, respectively, around 33 years of age, then very slightly increase to 0.697 and 0.712, respectively, around 47.5 years of age. The results show that age affects crash severity following a polynomial curve. While the overall pattern is one of a downward trend with age, this trend is weak until the senior years.

The spatial distribution of crashes associated with these driving behaviors by gender is also investigated, as well as the influence of some environmental and temporal variables on crash frequency and injury severity. This study adopted bivariate analysis and logistic regression modeling to identify the effect of different variables on crash occurrence and severity by gender. Male drivers were more likely to be involved in a speeding/DUI/lane departure-related crash and subsequent severe injuries. However, female drivers were slightly more associated with distracted-driving crashes and subsequent injuries. Nighttime, interstate/highway roads, the weekend period, and divider/marked lanes as the primary traffic control significantly increased the crash and injury risk of male drivers. Driving behavior-related crashes were mostly concentrated on some interstate road segments, major intersections, and interchanges.

Method Logistic regression models for injury severity of young male drivers and young female drivers were developed. Different driver, environmental, vehicle, and road related factors that have affected young female drivers' and young male drivers' crash involvements were identified using the models. Results Results indicated that some variables are significantly related to female drivers' injury risk but not male drivers' injury risk and vice versa. Variables such as driving with valid licenses, driving on weekends, avoidance or slow maneuvers at time of crash, non-collision and overturn crashes, and collision with a pedestrian were significant variables in female driver injury severity model but not in young male driver severity model. Travel on graded roadways, concrete surfaces, and wet road surfaces, collision with another vehicle, and rear-end collisions were variables that were significant in male-driver severity model but not in female-driver severity model.

It was hypothesized that decreasing visibility, contributed to by factors such as lighting, number of lanes, speed limit, and weather, are associated with an increase in injury severity. Some of the key results of the final model indicate that higher speed limits, less light conditions, and no traffic controls were significantly correlated with increased pedestrian injury severity when roadway visibility factors were under consideration. Dusk and dark with or without lighting were found to be factors correlated with increased pedestrian injury severity, while inclement weather was found to be correlated with lower pedestrian injury severity when environmental visibility-related factors were considered. Furthermore, a spatial autocorrelation revealed a high concentration of pedestrian–vehicle crashes in the Nashville and Memphis areas. This work is similar to prior works in their goal to study factors that affect pedestrian injury severity. While other models have looked at a large range of possible factors that may affect pedestrian injury severity, the model developed in this work focuses on visibility factors, environmental factors, and human-related factors.

However, unlike the other inclement weather conditions that have attracted extensive research interests, only a few studies have been conducted to investigate the impacts of risk factors on driver injury severity outcomes in low visibility related crashes. A three-year crash dataset including all low visibility related crashes from 2010 to 2012 in four South Central states, i.e., Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma, is adopted in this study. A finite mixture random parameters approach is developed to interpret both within-class and between-class unobserved heterogeneity among crash data. After a careful comparison, a two-class finite mixture random parameter model with normal distribution assumptions is selected as the final model. Estimation results show that three variables, including young (specific to injury, I), male (specific to serious injury and fatality, F), and large truck (specific to serious injury and fatality, F), are found to be normally distributed and have significant impacts on driver injury severities. Variables with fixed effects including rural, wet, 60 mph or higher, no statutory limit, dark, Sunday, curve, rollover, light truck, old, and drug/alcohol impaired also have significant influences on driver injury severities. This study provides an insightful understanding of the impacts of these variables on driver injury severity outcomes in low visibility related crashes, and a beneficial reference for developing countermeasures and strategies to mitigate driver injury severities under these conditions.},

The proposed model can simultaneously accommodate the ordered nature in severity levels and spatial correlation across adjacent crashes. Its strength is demonstrated by the existence of significant spatial correlation and its better model fit and more reasonable estimation results than the counterparts of a generalized ordered logit model. The estimation results show that an increase in the precipitation is associated with decreases in the probabilities of light and severe crashes, and an increase in the probability of medium crashes. Additionally, driver type, vehicle type, vehicle registered province, crash time, crash type, response time of emergency medical service, and horizontal curvature and vertical grade of the crash location, were also found to have significant effects on the crash severity.

   abstract = {This study aims to explore factors affecting passenger car and truck driver injury severity in passenger car-truck crashes. Police-reported crash data from 2007 to 2017 in Canada are collected. Two-vehicle crashes involving one truck and one passenger car are extracted for modeling. Different injury severities are not equally represented. To address the data imbalance issue, this study applies four different data imbalance treatment approaches, including over-sampling, under-sampling, a hybrid method, and a cost-sensitive learning method. To test the performances of different classifiers, five classification models are used, including multinomial logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Classification and Regression Tree, support vector machine, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). In both the passenger car driver and truck driver injury severity analysis, XGBoost combined with cost-sensitive learning generates the best results in terms of G-mean, area under the curve, and overall accuracy. Additionally, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) approach is adopted to interpret the result of the best-performing model. Most of the explanatory variables have similar effects on passenger car and truck driver fatality risks. Nevertheless, six variables exhibit opposite effects, including the age of the passenger car driver, crash hour, the passenger car age, road surface condition, weather condition and the truck age. Results of this study could provide some valuable insights for improving truck traffic safety. For instance, properly installing traffic control devices could be an effective way to reduce fatality risks in passenger car-truck crashes. Besides, passenger car drivers should be extremely cautious when driving between midnight to 6 am on truck corridors.},

   abstract = {Truck-involved crashes, especially truck-car crashes, are associated with serious and even fatal injuries, thus necessitating an in-depth analysis. Prior research focused solely on examining the injury severity of truck drivers or developed separate performance models for truck and car drivers. However, the severity of injuries to both drivers in the same truck-car crash may be interrelated, and influencing factors of injury severities sustained by the two parties may differ. To address these concerns, a random parameter bivariate probit model with heterogeneity in means (RPBPHM) is applied to examine factors affecting the injury severity of both drivers in the same truck-car crash and how these factors change over the years. Using truck-car crash data from 2017 to 2019 in the UK, the dependent variable is defined as slight injury and serious injury or fatality. Factors such as driver, vehicle, road, and environmental characteristics are statistically analyzed in this study. According to the findings, the RPBPHM model demonstrated a remarkable statistical fit, and a positive correlation was observed between the two drivers' injury severity in truck-car crashes. More importantly, the effects of the explanatory factors showing relatively temporal stability vary across different types of vehicle crashes. For example, car driver improper actions and lane changing by trucks, have a significant interactive effect on the severity of injuries sustained by drivers involved collisions between trucks and cars. Male truck drivers, young truck drivers, older truck drivers, and truck drivers' improper actions, elevate the estimated odds of only truck drivers; while older car and unsignalized crossing increase the possibility of injury severity of only car drivers. Finally, due to shared unobserved crash-specific factors, the 30-mph speed limit, dark no lights, and head-on collision, significantly affect the severity of injuries sustained by drivers involved in collisions between trucks and cars. The modeling approach provides a novel framework for jointly analyzing truck-involved crash injury severities. The findings will help policymakers take the necessary actions to reduce truck-car crashes by implementing appropriate and accurate safety countermeasures.},

However, few efforts focused on identifying the difference of impacting factors on injury severity between car-strike-truck and truck-strike-car in rear-end collisions. In light of the above, this study focuses on illustrating the impact of variables associated with injury severity in truck-related rear-end crashes. To this end, truck involved rearend crashes between 2006 and 2015 in the U.S. were obtained. Three random parameters ordered probit models were developed: two separate models for the car-strike-truck crashes and the truckstrike-car crashes, respectively, and one for the combined dataset. The likelihood ratio test was conducted to evaluate the significance of the difference between the models. The results show that there is a significant difference between car-strike-truck and truck-strike-car crashes in terms of contributing factors towards injury severity. In addition, indicators reflecting male, truck, starting or stopped in the road before a crash, and other vehicles stopped in lane show a mixed impact on injury severity. Corresponding implications were discussed according to the findings to reduce the possibility of severe injury in truck-involved rear-end collisions.},

Considering heteroscedasticity in the effects of explanatory variables on injury severity, the heteroscedastic ordered logit (HOL) models were developed for single- and two-vehicle crashes separately. The results of the models show that there exists heteroscedasticity for young drivers (≥30), safety equipment and ejection in the single-vehicle crash model, and female drivers, safety equipment and head-on collision in the two-vehicle crash models. The results also show that young car drivers have opposite effects between single-car and car-car crashes, and sideswipe crashes have opposite effects between car-car and truck-truck crashes.

However, the impact of different vehicle-truck collisions on corresponding occupant injury severity is lacking. Therefore, this paper advances the current research by undertaking an extensive assessment of the occupant injury severity in truck-involved crashes based on vehicle types (i.e., single-truck, truck-car, truck-SUV/pickup, and truck-truck), and identifies the major occupant-, crash-, and geometric-related contributing factors. A series of log-likelihood ratio tests were conducted to justify that separate model by vehicle and occupant types are warranted. Injury severity models were developed using 10 years of crash data (2007–2016) on I-80 in Wyoming through binary logistic modeling with a Bayesian inference approach. The modeling results indicated that there were significant differences between the influences of a variety of variables on the injury severities when the truck-involved crashes are broken down by vehicle types and separated by occupant types. The age and gender of occupants, truck driver occupation, driver residency, sideswipes, presence of junctions, downgrades, curves, and weather conditions were found to have significantly different impacts on the occupant injury severity in different vehicle-truck crashes. Finally, with the incorporation of the random intercept in the modeling procedure, the presence of intra-crash and intra-vehicle correlations (effects of the common crash- and vehicle-specific unobserved factors) in injury severities were identified among persons within the same crash and same vehicle.},

This paper contributes by undertaking an extensive analysis of the empirical factors affecting injury severity of large-truck crashes. Data from a recent, nationally representative sample of large-truck crashes are examined to determine the factors affecting the overall injury severity of these crashes. The explanatory factors include the characteristics of the crash, vehicle(s), and the driver(s). The injury severity was modeled using two measures. Several similarities and some differences were observed across the two models which underscore the need for improved accuracy in the assessment of injury severity of crashes. The estimated models capture the marginal effects of a variety of explanatory factors simultaneously. In particular, the models indicate the impacts of several driver behavior variables on the severity of the crashes, after controlling for a variety of other factors. For example, driver distraction (truck drivers), alcohol use (car drivers), and emotional factors (car drivers) are found to be associated with higher severity crashes. A further interesting finding is the strong statistical significance of several dummy variables that indicate missing data - these reflect how the nature of the crash itself could affect the completeness of the data. Future efforts should seek to collect such data more comprehensively so that the true effects of these aspects on the crash severity can be determined. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A partial proportionality odds model was developed to identify factors contributing to injury severity of teen drivers. The results obtained indicate that teen drivers driving sports utility vehicles and pickup trucks are more likely to be severely injured when compared to teen drivers driving passenger cars. Teen drivers are more likely to be severely injured on weekdays, particularly during peak hours. The chances of teen drivers getting involved in severe injury crashes on Tuesdays and Fridays is higher when compared to Sundays.

This research examines the differences in motorcycle crash injury severity considering crashes involving the compliance with and defiance of helmet use by motorcycle riders and highlights the temporal variation in their impact. Three-year (2017–2019) motorcycle crash data were collected from RESCUE 1122, a provincial emergency response service for Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The available crash data include crash-specific information, vehicle, driver, spatial and temporal characteristics, roadway features, and traffic volume, which influence the motorcyclist’s injury severity. A random parameters logit model with heterogeneity in means and variances was evaluated to predict critical contributory factors in helmet-wearing and non-helmet-wearing motorcyclist crashes. Model estimates suggest significant variations in the impact of explanatory variables on motorcyclists’ injury severity in the case of compliance with and defiance of helmet use. For helmet-wearing motorcyclists, key factors significantly associated with increasingly severe injury and fatal injuries include young riders (below 20 years of age), female pillion riders, collisions with another motorcycle, large trucks, passenger car, drivers aged 50 years and above, and drivers being distracted while driving. In contrast, for non-helmet-wearing motorcyclists, the significant factors responsible for severe injuries and fatalities were distracted driving, the collision of two motorcycles, crashes at U-turns, weekday crashes, and drivers above 50 years of age. The impact of parameters that predict motorcyclist injury severity was found to vary dramatically over time, exhibiting statistically significant temporal instability. The results of this study can serve as potential motorcycle safety guidelines for all relevant stakeholders to improve the state of motorcycle safety in the country.},

These vehicles are operated in a mixed traffic environment and prohibited on highways. In light of increasing motorcycle casualties, we conducted a multicentre study to analyse rider factors affecting injury severity. Methods Riders hospitalised upon LMC crashes were contacted. Information on demographics, comorbidities, and riding behaviours was collected through questionnaires and linked to hospital data. The injury severity score (ISS) and length of hospitalisation (LOH) were used as injury severity measures. Results In total, 725 patients (mean age: 37.7 years; 64% men) completed their questionnaires. Multivariate analysis results showed that age 65 years, half-face helmets, protective clothing, collisions with a bus/truck or car, and fatigue riding were risk factors for having an ISS of 9. Age 65 years; motorcycle crashes 2 times in the previous year; anaemia; rural crashes; half-face helmets; protective boots; collisions with a bus/truck, car, or a stationary object; alcohol/stimulating refreshment consumption; and fatigue riding were risk factors for increased LOH. A protective factor was individuals working in commerce. Collisions with opening car doors caused low risks of having an ISS of 9 and a short LOH. Conclusion Certain factors were significantly associated with riders’ injury severity and related medical resource consumption. Because of differences in the power output, use, and riding environment, risk factors for severe injuries in LMC crashes are dissimilar from those for heavy motorcycles (cylinder capacities > 250 cc) in developed countries and deserve more attention for injury prevention. Further in-depth evaluation of significant factors based on this study’s results can yield valuable information to reduce severe injuries after LMC crashes in countries and areas with a high dependency on motorcycles, even considering the popularity of electric motorcycles.},

This study estimated severity models of these two crash types. Vehicle, driver, roadway, and median cross-section design data were factors considered in the models. A unique aspect of the data used to estimate the models were the availability of median cross-slope data, which are not commonly included in roadway inventory data files. Methods: A binary logit model of cross-median crash severity and a multinomial logit model of rollover crash severity were estimated using five years of data from rural divided highways in Pennsylvania. Results: The highest probability of a fatal or major injury in cross-median and rollover crashes was found to occur in cases when a driver was not wearing a seatbelt. While flatter cross-slopes and narrower medians were associated with more severe cross-median crash outcomes, steeper cross-slopes and narrower medians significantly increased rollover crash severity outcomes. The presence of horizontal curves was associated with increased probabilities of high-severity outcomes in a median rollover crash. Impact on Industry: Modeling results in this study confirmed that cross-median and median rollover crash severity outcomes are associated with median cross-section design characteristics. Based on the estimated models, it appears that flatter and narrower medians lead to more severe injury outcomes in cross-median crashes. Steeper median cross-slopes and narrower medians were associated with higher probabilities of more severe outcomes in median rollover crashes. The results presented in this study suggest that there is a trade-off between median cross-section design and cross-median and rollover crashes in earth-divided, traversable medians on rural divided highways. While the severity models can be included in a framework to develop design guidance in relation to this trade-off, models of crash frequency should also be considered. © 2011 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

Ordinal discrete choice modeling efforts for investigating the nexus between the underlying severity propensity and miscellaneous roadway-safety-related factors for single- and multivehicle CMCs that occurred from 2001 to 2007 in Wisconsin are described. Ordinal logit (ORL) and probit (ORP) models were employed for the severity analyses. For multivehicle CMCs, the final ORP model found that road condition has a significant effect on severity. Adverse road conditions enhance the likelihood of a more severe consequence if a CMC occurs. Winter precipitation negatively affects CMC severity, and logically Wisconsin's geographical location plays a significant role. The final ORL model found that alcohol and drug use incurs more severe consequences when a CMC occurs. Both models found that more severe injuries occur on roadways posted with higher speed limits. The similarity and dissimilarity in findings by both models imply that it is necessary for safety researchers to apply distinct statistical methods when pursuing a comprehensive understanding of a study topic. The final ORP model for single-vehicle CMCs shows that alcohol and drug use, lane curvature, and unfriendly lighting conditions exacerbate the severity tendency if a CMC happens. A dry road surface is found to incur more severe consequences; this result implies that more severe single-vehicle CMCs are closely related to maintaining overly high speeds. All ORL regression models for single-vehicle CMCs were found statistically invalid. Median width and average daily traffic were found insignificant for both multivehicle and single-vehicle CMCs.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Roadway departure (RwD) crashes, comprising run-off-road (ROR) and cross-median/centerline head-on collisions, are one of the most lethal crash types. According to the FHWA, between 2015 and 2017, an average of 52 percent of motor vehicle traffic fatalities occurred each year due to roadway departure crashes. An avoidance maneuver, inattention or fatigue, or traveling too fast with respect to weather or geometric road conditions are among the most common reasons a driver leaves the travel lane. Roadway and roadside geometric design features such as clear zones play a significant role in whether human error results in a crash. Method: In this paper, we used mixed-logit models to investigate the contributing factors on injury severity of single-vehicle ROR crashes. To that end, we obtained five years' (2010–2014) of crash data related to roadway departures (i.e., overturn and fixed-object crashes) from the Federal Highway Administration's Highway Safety Information System Database. Results: The results indicate that factors such as driver conditions (e.g., age), environmental conditions (e.g., weather conditions), roadway geometric design features (e.g., shoulder width), and vehicle conditions significantly contributed to the severity of ROR crashes. Conclusions: Our results provide valuable information for traffic design and management agencies to improve roadside design policies and implementing appropriately forgiving roadsides for errant vehicles. Practical applications: Our results show that increasing shoulder width and keeping fences at the road can reduce ROR crash severity significantly. Also, increasing road friction by innovative materials and raising awareness campaigns for careful driving at daylight can decrease the ROR crash severity.},

The objective is to provide deeper insight into significant factors that affect crash severities involving fixed roadside objects, through improved statistical efficiency along with disaggregate and multivariate analysis. Method: The developed models are multivariate nested logit models of injury severity and they are estimated with statistical efficiency using the method of full information maximum likelihood. Results: The results show that leading ends of guardrails and bridge rails, along with large wooden poles (e.g. trees and utility poles) increase the probability of fatal injury. The face of guardrails is associated with a reduction in the probability of evident injury, and concrete barriers are shown to be associated with a higher probability of lower severities. Other variables included driver characteristics, which showed expected results, validating the model. For example, driving over the speed limit and driving under the influence of alcohol increase the probability of fatal accidents. Drivers that do not use seatbelts are associated with an increase in the probability of more severe injuries, even when an airbag is activated. Impact on industry: The presented models show the contribution of guardrail leading ends toward fatal injuries. It is therefore important to use well-designed leading ends and to upgrade badly performing leading ends on guardrails and bridges. The models also indicate the importance of protecting vehicles from crashes with rigid poles and tree stumps, as these are linked with greater severities and fatalities. © 2005 National Sefety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate the temporal stability and differences of contributing factors determining different injury severity levels in overturned and hit-fixed-object crashes on rural roads accompanied by speeding driving, this paper estimates two groups of correlated random parameters logit models with heterogeneity in the means (one group relating to overturned crashes and the other relating to hit-fixed-object crashes). Three injury-severity categories are determined as outcome variables: severe injury, minor injury and no injury, while multiple factors are investigated as explanatory variables including driver, vehicle, roadway, environmental, and crash characteristics. The overall temporal instability and non-transferability between overturned and hit-fixed-object crashes are captured through likelihood ratio tests. Marginal effects are adopted to further exhibit temporal variations of the explanatory variables. Despite the overall temporal instability, some variables still present relative temporal stability such as alcohol, truck, aggressive driving, vehicle age (>14 years old), and speed limit (<45 mph). This non-transferability between overturned and hit-fixed-object crashes provides insights into developing differentiated strategies targeted at mitigating and preventing different types of crashes. Besides, out-of-sample prediction is undertaken given the captured temporal instability and non-transferability of overturned and hit-fixed-object crash observations. More studies can be conducted to accommodate the spatial instability, under-reporting of severe-injury crashes, the trade-off between model predictive capability, inference capability, and selectivity bias.},

The likelihood ratio test indicated that crash-related factors are instable when comparing the models utilizing data before and after 2010 respectively. This study contributes to the current knowledge in the field, as to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that addresses unobserved heterogeneity when analyzing child and adolescent injury severity. Overall, the findings of this study provide useful insights and could assist in unveiling crash risk factors and prioritize programs and measures to promote road safety of children and adolescents.},

To capture potential unobserved heterogeneity, random parameters logit models with heterogeneity in the means and variances of the random parameters were estimated considering three possible crash injury-severity outcomes (no injury, minor injury, and severe injury). Likelihood ratio tests were conducted to assess the transferability of model estimation results from different times of the day and from year to year. Marginal effects of the explanatory variables were also calculated to investigate the stability of individual parameter estimates on injury-severity probabilities across time-of-day/time-period combinations. A wide range of parameters were considered including drivers’ characteristics, driver actions, truck's characteristics, weather and environmental conditions, and roadway attributes. The results show instability in the effect of factors that influence injury severities in large-truck vehicle crashes across daily time periods and from year to year. However, there were several variables that exhibited relatively stable effects on injury-severity probabilities including driver ethnicity, crashes occurring while backing, sideswipe crashes, hit-object crashes, parked-vehicle crashes, fixed-object crashes, and truck-driver at fault crashes. The findings of this study should be useful for decision makers and trucking companies to better regulate truck operations by time of day.},

   abstract = {Although crashes involving hazardous materials (HAZMAT) are rare events compared with other types of traffic crashes, they often cause tremendous loss of life and property, as well as severe hazards to the environment and public safety. Using five-year (2013–2017) crash data (N = 1610) from the Highway Safety Information System database, a two-step machine learning-based approach was proposed to investigate and quantify the statistical relationship between three HAZMAT crash severity outcomes (fatal and severe injury, injury, and no injury) and contributing factors, including the driver, road, vehicle, crash, and environmental characteristics. Random forest ranked the importance of risk factors, and then Bayesian networks were developed to provide probabilistic inference. The results show that fatal and severe HAZMAT crashes are closely associated with younger drivers (age less than 25), driver fatigue, violation, distraction, special roadway locations (such as intersections, ramps, and bridges), higher speed limits (over 66 mph), midnight and early morning (12:00–5:59 a.m.), head-on crashes, more than four vehicles, fire/explosion/spill, poor lighting conditions, and adverse weather conditions. The overall prediction accuracy of 85.8% suggests the effectiveness of the proposed method. This study extends machine learning applications in a HAZMAT crash analysis, which would help develop targeted countermeasures and strategies to improve HAZMAT road transportation safety.},

   abstract = {Crash severity of a hazardous material (HAZMAT) transporting truck increases manyfold compared with normal truck crash because of the possible exposure to dangerous substances. Crashes which involve a HAZMAT truck might result in a catastrophic incident causing horrendous damage to individuals involved in the crash. In-transit HAZMAT crashes in Wyoming caused a total damage of $3.1 million from 2015 to 2018. HAZMAT crashes on interstate roads represented 22% of the total HAZMAT crashes causing a total damage of $2.2 million, representing 71% of the cost of total damage. Previous studies in Wyoming investigated all vehicle crashes, including large truck crashes, but none has analyzed HAZMAT-related crashes or accounted for its type as a contributing factor. This study fills the gap by analyzing crash injury severity of HAZMAT-related crashes on all interstate freeways in Wyoming. Furthermore, the study introduces the No-U-Turn (NUT) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method of hierarchical Bayesian analysis into HAZMAT crash injury severity analysis. In recent developments, NUT HMC has been proven to be the most efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method. The results showed that 30% of the unobserved heterogeneity arises from variation in summer and winter crashes which justifies the use of hierarchical model. Among the other covariates investigated, the population-averaged effects showed that number of trucks involved, hit-and-run crashes, animal-vehicle crashes, work-zone-related crashes, collision type, percentage of females involved, drivers’ drug/alcohol use, seat-belt use, crash location, roadway curves, and surface conditions significantly impact HAZMAT crash injury severity.},

   abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to explore a suitable method for analyzing road transport accidents that involve hazardous materials and to explore the main factors that influence the occurrence of accidents of varying severity. Methods: The 2015–2019 reported crash data from the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China were obtained, and road transport crashes involving hazardous materials were extracted as the analysis data. The dataset was classified into three injury severity categories: property damage only (PDO), injured (INJ), and fatal (FAT). A statistical model and three machine learning-based models were developed: a random parameters logit model (RPLM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree C5.0 (C5.0) and support vector machine (SVM). The four models were trained/estimated using the training/estimation dataset, and the best model was used to model accidents of the three different severity levels. The main factors that influence the occurrence of accidents at each crash severity level were obtained. Results: C5.0 had the best modeling performance. The direct accident form (DAF), indirect accident form (IAF) and road segment (RS) were determined to be the critical determinants of PDO accidents. The DAF, IAF, road type, RS and time had a substantial effect on INJ accidents. The DAF, IAF, hazardous material type (HMT) and road surface condition were important factors in the occurrence of FAT accidents. Conclusions: Different data have unique characteristics, and the best modeling and analysis method should be chosen accordingly. The safety of road transport of hazardous materials in China is poor, and the losses caused by accidents are substantial. Strengthening the monitoring of travel speed and travel time; improving driver safety awareness, driving skills and the ability to mitigate emergencies; improving the configuration of vehicle safety equipment and the linkage with the control center and rescue center; improving the environmental differences between inside a tunnel and outside a tunnel; reducing the design of long downhill and steep slope sections; reducing the transport plan in unsafe environments; and improving the ability of road management to mitigate bad environments can be effective measures to reduce the severity of road transport accidents involving hazardous materials.},

Both the injuries and the number of people evacuated were considered as the indicator of accident severity and investigated, respectively. Results show that higher injury severity is likely to be associated with type of Hazmat (compressed gas, explosive, and poison), misoperation, driver fatigue, speeding, tunnel, slope, county road, dry road surface, winter, dark, more than two vehicles, rear end crash, and explosion. As for the correlation between risk factors and the severity of evacuation, type of Hazmat (compressed gas, explosive, and poison), quantity of Hazmat (10–39 t), misoperation, county road, dry road surface, weekdays, dusk, explosion significantly contribute to increasing the severity of evacuation of Hazmat accidents.},

To ensure more efficient accident response, this study applied a random parameter hazard-based Weibull modeling approach to measure the relationship between crash characteristics and accident duration for trucks transporting HAZMAT. The study focuses on finding the key factors that have an impact on the accident duration of these vehicles as well as a statistical method to estimate the accident duration. The analysis is based on raw crash data from 2007 to 2017, obtained from the Korea Expressway Corporation, of crashes that involved HAZMAT trucks. The study found that crashes occurring during peak times of the day; crashes occurring on segments at the mainline, ramp, and roadways with a guardrail; and the number of vehicles involved in a crash, result in random parameters. In addition, the weather, season, crash severity, truck size, crash location, type of accident report, roadside features (e.g., guardrails), and status after a crash, can be used to explain the accident duration. The random parameters hazard-based model is found to have a better fit than a fixed model since it is able to capture the unobserved heterogeneity in the hazard function.},

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) HRGC crash dataset (2007–2016) yielded two subsets of crashes: 1) those involving hazmat-carrying trucks, and 2) those involving hazmat-carrying trains. Results from a logistic regression model using data subset 1 (crashes involving hazmat-carrying trucks) with hazmat release/no release as the response variable showed that standard flashing signal lights, railroad crossbucks, and railroad classes II and III (relative to railroad class I) were associated with lower hazmat release probability from hazmat-carrying trucks. Hazmat release probability from trucks was higher with freight train involvement. Results from a logistic regression model using data subset 2 (crashes involving hazmat-carrying trains) revealed that hazmat release probability from trains was lower with warmer temperature. However, the probability of release from trains was greater with railroad class II (relative to railroad class I), type of highway user (different types of trucks and motorcycle relative to automobiles), and weather conditions (fog, sleet or snow, relative to clear).

Compared to other collision types, head-on crashes account for about 12% of total crashes in Malaysia yet are responsible for 17% of total fatal crashes. This indicates that head-on crashes are among the most fatal collision types. However, very few studies have been focused on the injury severity of head-on crashes. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the factors that are hypothesized to be associated with driver injury severity in head-on crashes. To do this, a generalized ordered probit (GOP) model was applied using 4-year (2009–2012) crash data collected on two-lane rural highways in Malaysia. The results show that the factors of dark not-lighted condition, horizontal curvature, heavy vehicle percentage, light vehicle traffic, posted speed limit, undulating terrain, improper overtaking maneuvers, not wearing seatbelt, and vehicle age contributed to more severe injuries, whereas rainy weather condition was found to be the only factor that was associated with less severe outcome. The findings of this study can help safety authorities understand the relationship between various risk factors and head-on crash severity.},

This research incorporated the examination of intersection crash data in Wyoming to examine injury severity risk factors in this crash type. The study examined a set of potential roadway, driver, crash, and environmental risk factors, including pavement surface friction, which is a commonly omitted factor in relevant studies. A random-parameters ordinal probit model was developed for the analysis. The findings demonstrated that two crash attributes (motorcycle involvement and improper seat belt use), three driver’s attributes (driver’s condition, age, and gender), and two environmental and roadway characteristics (road condition and pavement friction) impacted the injury severity of rear-end crashes at signalized intersections.},

Therefore, the present investigation focused on the comparison of diverse factors affecting the likelihood of rear-end crash severities in the two types of roadways. Additionally, hierarchical logistic models grounded in a spatial basis concept were applied by determining varying parameter estimations with regard to road segments. Additionally, the study compared coefficients with multilevel correlation model and those without multilevel correlation. Four models were established as a result. The data used for the study pertained to rear-end crashes occurring on Thai highways between 2011 and 2015. The results of the data analysis revealed that the model parameters for both urban and rural areas are in the same direction with the larger number of significant parameter values present in the rural rear-end crash model. The significant variables in both the urban and rural road segment models are the seat belt use, and the time of the incident. To conclude, the present study is useful because it provides another perspective of rear-end crashes to encourage policy makers to apply decisions that favor rules that assure safety.},

In Thailand, the MC crash investigation data revealed that 18% of all MC crashes were rear-end collisions, which accounted for 18% of all fatalities as well. The aim of this study was to investigate the causes of injuries and deaths from MC rear-end collisions and factors that contribute to their severity level. Between 2016 and 2020, 141 MC rear-end crashes were thoroughly investigated throughout Thailand. Method: The ordinal logistic analysis was conducted to analyze factors contributing to severe injuries. The analysis to rear-end collision models comprised four categories: M1 (n = 141) is all types of rear-end collisions to MC, and M2 (n = 114) is the rear-end collision due to other vehicles (OV) collided by MC, M3 (n = 72) is the rear-end collisions for traveling OV collided by MC, and M4 (n = 42) is the rear-end collision for MC hitting the parked OV. The outcomes are verified by the likelihood and Pseudo R2. Result: When a MC collides with the rear of another vehicle, there are more fatalities than when other vehicles collide with the rear of a MC. Furthermore, the probability of death is higher if MCs collide with the rear-end of parking vehicles. As for the primary crash contributing factor, motorcyclists’ perception failure was the most frequent. Experience, license status, driving conditions, speed, the time of the crash, the areas of the crash, and types of other vehicles involved significantly influence the severity of rear-end crashes. Conclusion: In severe crashes, riders with perception failure are more likely to be involved. Based on the findings of this study, some policies and countermeasures can be drawn to prevent MC rear-end crashes and reduce their severity.},

The data was extracted from the police-reported crash data from September 2017 to August 2018 within the City of Chicago. Two multinomial logistic regression models were established for the HR and NHR crash data, respectively.

In both models, the property damage only (PDO) crash was selected as the reference group, and the injury and fatal crash were chosen as the comparison group. When the injury crash was taken as the comparison group, it was found that 12 variables contributed to the crash severities in both HR and NHR model. The average percentage deviation of OR for these 12 variables was 34%, indicating that compared with property damage, HR crashes were 34% more likely to result in injuries than NHR crashes on average. When fatal crashes were chosen as the comparison group, 2 variables were found to be statistically significant in both the HR and the NHR model.

For this reason, it is assumed that hit-and-run crashes lead to more serious injuries; however, the research in this area is limited. The objectives of the study are to examine the differences in hit-and-run and non-hit-and-run victim injury severities and to identify the factors that may influence any differences. Methods: Quasi-induced exposure technique, an indirect method, is employed to measure the relative crash exposures between hit-and-run and non-hit-and-run crashes using Michigan two-vehicle injury crashes 2012–2014. Random parameter ordered logit model is used to reveal the discrepancy of the factors contributing to victim injury severity. Results: We found that the injuries sustained by the drivers left at the scene (victims) of hit-and-run crashes were generally less severe compared to non-hit-and-run driver victims, which may be attributed to the differential crash factors in terms of driver age and vehicle type. The injury-severity contributing factors of hit-and-run crashes differed considerably from the non-hit-and-run crashes. Characteristics such as occurring in rural areas, at nighttime, at intersections, crash type, and alcohol involvement significantly increased the injury severities of the driver victims. Conclusion: We inform the hit-and-run literature to suggest a contradiction to the assumption that leaving the crash scene may lead to more serious injuries. This example emphasizes the importance of distinguishing different types of crashes and their contributing factors. We offer an indirect approach that can help to identify underlying factors and reduce bias, which can inform traffic safety methods and serve to propose effective safety countermeasures.},

This study explores several factors that increase the likelihood of pedestrian hit-and-run crashes, including temporal factors, environmental factors, crash characteristics, and road features. One hundred ten variables under 30 factors were assessed for statistically significant association with hit-and-run crashes. Results and conclusions: The results of the present study show that the perpetrator’s tendency to leave the spot of crash increases in the dark unlighted conditions. Increased likelihood of hit-and-run crashes is found during summer, winter season and in urban areas. Among pedestrian characteristics, pedestrians who are intoxicated, pedestrian locations such as footpath, crossing the road and shoulder, pedestrian victims who are injured significantly contribute to hit-and-run crashes. Factors such as day of the week, road category, collision cause, vehicle type, weather conditions, driver alcohol status, pedestrian residence type, and traffic movement were found to be statistically not significant with a 90% confidence interval. We finally discuss a few recommendations based on the results and intervention that can reduce hit-and-run pedestrian fatalities and injuries.},

   abstract = {Among different types of crashes, hit-and-run is driver's failure to stop after a vehicle crash. There are many accidents where drivers could actually be at fault or totally innocent, and leaving the scene would turn an innocent driver into a criminal. The current paper aims to contribute to the literature by exploring the association of different variables pertaining to the condition of infrastructure, environment, driver, population of the area, and crash severity and type with hit-and-run crashes. The analysis is performed for two data sets: (i) crashes where the driver was distracted; and (ii) crashes where driver was not distracted. Hit-and-run crash data with corresponding factors are police-reported data for crashes within Cook County, Illinois, occurring between 2004 and 2012. A logistic regression model assessed 43 variables within 16 categories for statistically significant association with hit-and-run crashes, for drivers with and without distraction. For both driver distraction statuses, 17 variables were associated with a significant increased probability of a hit-and-run crash and 10 variables were associated with a significant decreased probability. Additionally, it was found that crashes on curve level and curve hillcrest road alignment types were associated with increased likelihood of a hit-and-run crash when the driver was distracted and decreased likelihood when the driver was not distracted. Variables related to hit-and-run crashes vary depending on driver's distraction status. When comparing likelihood to flee the scene after a crash, non-distracted drivers are 27% less likely to do so compared to distracted drivers.},

   abstract = {Hit-and-run crashes not only degrade the morality, but also result in delays of medical services provided to victims. However, class imbalance problem exists as the number of hit-and-run crashes is much smaller than that of non-hit-and-run crashes. The missing label problem also exists in the crash analysis due to reasons like data barrier such that the information hidden in the unlabelled samples has not been effectively utilised. In this paper, a cost-sensitive semi-supervised logistic regression (CS3LR) model is proposed for hit-and-run analysis, in order to tackle class-imbalanced data distribution and missing label problem, based on the crash dataset of Victorian, Australia (2013–2019). By performing label estimation with logistic regression jointly utilising both labelled and unlabelled data with pseudo labels in a well-designed cost-sensitive semi-supervised maximum likelihood framework, the proposed model can obtain an unbiased likelihood parameter for hit-and-run prediction and analysis. Comparing the experimental results of CS3LR model with two logistic regression models and seven machine learning methods, better performance of CS3LR model is demonstrated. The most significant contributing factors to hit-and-run crashes extracted by CS3LR with only 10% labelled data show a high degree of consistency with the true contributing factors obtained by the supervised cost-sensitive logistic regression with complete hit-and-run labels. The effects of class-weighted ratio and hyper-parameter λ on the performance of hit-and-run crash prediction model have also been analysed. The results can further provide recommendations and implications on the policies and counter-measures for preventing hit-and-run collisions and crimes. The methodology proposed in this paper can also be employed to analyse crash data with other types of missing labels, such as crash severity.},

   abstract = {The contributing factors to secondary crashes have been investigated by a number of studies in recent years. However, previous studies generally considered only the first secondary crash after the primary crash. Existing studies have seldom considered the multiple secondary crashes caused by one primary crash and the effects of real-time traffic flow conditions. This paper aimed to investigate the effects of real-time traffic flow conditions on the frequency of secondary crashes caused by one primary crash on freeways. The zero-inflated ordered probit (ZIOP) regression model was developed to link the probability of multiple secondary crashes after the occurrence of one primary crash with real-time traffic flow, geometric, weather and primary crash characteristics. The ZIOP regression model analyzed the probability of secondary crash frequency after one primary crash by separating it into two states. One is a secondary-crash-free state that determines whether the occurrence of a crash will lead to one or more secondary crashes, and the other is a secondary-crash-prone state that determines the secondary crash frequency caused by one primary crash. The average speed, average traffic volume, and the difference between the numbers of on-ramp and off-ramp are the significant variables in the secondary-crash-free state. In the secondary-crash-prone state, the significant variables affecting the probability of multiple secondary crashes include average detector occupancy, rainy weather, primary crash severity, and hit-and-run primary crash. The ROC curves were used to test predictive performance of the ZIOP model. The test results suggested that the ZIOP model provide reasonably good predictive accuracy of multiple secondary crashes caused by one primary crash.},

   abstract = {Objective: Most of the extensive research dedicated to identifying the influential factors of hit-and-run (HR) crashes has utilized typical maximum likelihood estimation binary logit models, and none have employed real-time traffic data. To fill this gap, this study focused on investigating factors contributing to HR crashes, as well as the severity levels of HR. Methods: This study analyzed 4-year crash and real-time loop detector data by employing hierarchical Bayesian models with random effects within a sequential logit structure. In addition to evaluation of the impact of random effects on model fitness and complexity, the prediction capability of the models was examined. Stepwise incremental sensitivity and specificity were calculated and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to graphically illustrate the predictive performance of the model. Results: Among the real-time flow variables, the average occupancy and speed from the upstream detector were observed to be positively correlated with HR crash possibility. The average upstream speed and speed difference between upstream and downstream speeds were correlated with the occurrence of severe HR crashes. In addition to real-time factors, other variables found influential for HR and severe HR crashes were length of segment, adverse weather conditions, dark lighting conditions with malfunctioning street lights, driving under the influence of alcohol, width of inner shoulder, and nighttime. Conclusions: This study suggests the potential traffic conditions of HR and severe HR occurrence, which refer to relatively congested upstream traffic conditions with high upstream speed and significant speed deviations on long segments. The above findings suggest that traffic enforcement should be directed toward mitigating risky driving under the aforementioned traffic conditions. Moreover, enforcement agencies may employ alcohol checkpoints to counter driving under the influence (DUI) at night. With regard to engineering improvements, wider inner shoulders may be constructed to potentially reduce HR cases and street lights should be installed and maintained in working condition to make roads less prone to such crashes.},

   abstract = {Many studies examine the road characteristics that impact the severity of truck crash accidents. However, some only analyze the effect of curves or slopes separately, ignoring their combination. Therefore, there are nine types of the combination of curve and slope in this study. The combination of curve and slope factor that affected the injury severity of truck crashes on mountainous freeways was examined using a correlated random parameter logit model. This method is applied to evaluate the correlation between the random parameters and those that exhibit unobserved heterogeneity. Also, the multinomial logit model and traditional random parameter logit model are used. The study's data were collected from multi-vehicle truck crashes on mountainous freeways in China. The results showed that the correlated random parameters logit model was better than the others. In addition, they demonstrated a correlation between the random parameters. Based on the estimation coefficients and marginal effects, the combination of curve and slope has a great influence on the injury severity of truck crashes. The main finding is that curve with medium radius and medium slope will significantly increase the probability of medium severity comparing to curve with high radius and flat slope. On the other hand, the injury severity of truck accidents was significantly impacted by crash type, vehicle type, surface condition, time of day, season, lighting condition, pavement type, and guardrail. Variables such as sideswipe, head-on, medium trucks, morning, dawn or dusk and summertime reduced the probability of truck crashes. Rollover, winter, gravel, and guardrail variables increased the risk of truck crashes. Correlations were also discovered between a rollover and dry surface condition and rollover and gravel pavement type. The research findings will help traffic officials determine effective countermeasures to decrease the severity of truck crashes on mountainous freeways.},

Ordered logit models were selected for the analysis because of the ordinal nature of crash severity. The final model consists of seven independent variables: temperature below-7°C, temperature above 19°C, rainfall exceeding 5 mm/d, working day of the week, density (vehicles/km), roadside equipment and season of the year. These variables were found to have significant values at 0·95 confidence intervals. The model also showed that the probability of occurrence of a PDO crash is 77·5%, while the probability of occurrence of injury and fatal crashes are 18·9% and 3·6%, respectively.},

A model comparison as well as the elasticities for the optimal model (partial proportional odds model) is implemented based on 18,083 SV crashes and 22,162 MV crashes in China. The results evidenced the great differences that time, road, speed, lighting, and weather are found to have a positive correlation with only SV crash injury severity, yet negatively related with only MV crash injury severity. Area, location, and angle are significant only for SV crashes, while day, interference, and wind are significant only for MV crashes. The findings revealed that gender, age, collision, location, and time are more influencing factors in SV crashes, while collision, age, gender, vehicle, and wind have more contributions to MV crashes.

   abstract = {In recent years, traffic safety researchers have attempted to separate single-vehicle and multi-vehicle crashes when analyzing crash severity, considering the significant differences in the mechanism of occurrence of the two crash types. However, regardless of the number of vehicles involved in a crash, the severity of a crash is defined by the most severe injury outcome sustained by the occupants, not vehicles. Thus, this study evaluated a need for conducting a separate severity analysis for crashes involving a single occupant (SO) and multiple occupants (MO). Ten-year data (2009–2018) of crashes that involved a collision between a single vehicle and a train at the highway-rail grade crossings (HRGCs) across the United States was used as a case study. Crashes were grouped based on occupancy level; that is, crashes involving SO were separated from the ones involving MO. As expected, MO crashes had higher injury and fatality rates than SO crashes. Three Multinomial Logit (MNL) models were developed to analyze the crash severity of SO crashes, MO crashes, and total crashes. The study found several differences in associated factors when SO crashes and MO crashes were modeled separately. Overall, combining SO and MO crashes tend to either underestimate or overestimate the actual impact of the predictor variable on a specific crash type. Among the variables, train speed and vehicle speed during crash showed a great difference. The findings provide evidence that the severity analysis of the SO and MO crashes should be performed separately as they have different characteristics.},

Previous studies have used only information about the most severely injured driver to represent the crash severity, ignoring other drivers involved in the crash, which can also be important to explain the crash severity. This study uses demographic information of all drivers involved in a multi-vehicle crash to predict the injury severity of the most severely injured driver using a partial proportional odds model. Models incorporating demographic information and vehicle characteristics of all drivers and vehicles involved in a crash were compared with models considering only information about the most severely injured driver in terms of significance of factors and prediction accuracy. The results indicate that although young drivers are likely to have lower levels of injury severity compared to working-age drivers, injury severity increases if the proportion of young drivers increases in a multi-vehicle crash. Drivers indicated to be not at fault frequently were more severely injured than drivers at fault. Finally, the inclusion of all drivers’ demographic information shows an improvement in the prediction accuracy of crash severity of the most severely injured driver.},

This study aims to investigate the effects of rider characteristics, road conditions, pre-crash situations, and crash features on motorcycle severities with respect to different numbers of vehicles involved. The crash data used was obtained through a comprehensive Motorcycle Crash Causation Study (MCCS) by the Federal Highway Administration. An anatomic injury severity indicator, the New Injury Severity Score (NISS), is utilized to calculate a total score as the sum of squared the abbreviated injury scale scores of each of the rider's three most severe injuries. A hybrid approach integrating Latent Class Clustering (LCC) and Ordered Probit (OP) models was used to uncover the unobserved heterogeneity and to explore the major factors which significantly affect the injury severities resulting from single-, two- and multi-vehicle crashes involving a motorcycle. The results show that the significant differences in severity exist between different numbers of vehicles involved. More importantly, they also indicate dividing motorcycle crashes into homogeneous classes before modelling helps to discover insightful information. Pre-speed of the motorcycle is found to be a main factor associated with serious and critical injuries in most types of crashes.

Specifically, this paper presents: (a) a methodology that combines detailed 15-min weather station data with crash and roadway data, and (b) an empirical investigation of the effects of weather on crash-related injury severities of single-vehicle truck crashes. Method Random parameters ordinal and multinomial regression models were used to investigate crash injury severity under different weather conditions, taking into account the individual unobserved heterogeneity. The adopted methodology allowed consideration of environmental, roadway, and climate-related variables in single-vehicle truck crash injury severity. Results and conclusions Results showed that wind speed, rain, humidity, and air temperature were linked with single-vehicle truck crash injury severity. Greater recorded wind speed added to the severity of injuries in single-vehicle truck crashes in general. Rain and warmer air temperatures were linked to more severe crash injuries in single-vehicle truck crashes while higher levels of humidity were linked to less severe injuries. Random parameters ordered logit and multinomial logit, respectively, revealed some individual heterogeneity in the data and showed that integrating comprehensive weather data with crash data provided useful insights into factors associated with single-vehicle truck crash injury severity. Practical applications The research provided a practical method that combined comprehensive 15-min weather station data with crash and roadway data, thereby providing useful insights into crash injury severity of single-vehicle trucks. Those insights are useful for future truck driver educational programs and for truck safety in different weather conditions.},

Although it is not without its limitations the dataset used in this study includes single-vehicles rollover crash instances from 2014 to 2016 within Namibia and is able to provide unique details for the crash observations including various driver, environmental, roadway, and vehicle characteristics. Results from this study indicate several factors including weekends, open roadways, and minibuses to be significantly increasing the crash severity of single-vehicle rollover crashes. Additionally, results provide a basis for which researchers and policy makers can understand rollover crashes in Namibia and adopt an appropriate approach to address this issue, such as, Safe Systems.

Crash data from 2012 to 2016 for the State of Alabama was used for this study. Latent class logit models were developed as alternative to the frequently used random parameters models to account for unobserved heterogeneity across crash-severity observations. Exploration of the data revealed that a high proportion of severe injury injury crashes happened on weekends. The study examined whether single-vehicle crash contributing factors differ between weekdays and weekends. The model estimation results indicate a significant association of severe injury crashes to risk factors such as driver unemployment, driving with invalid license, no seatbelt use, fatigue, driving under influence, old age, and driving on county roads for both weekdays and weekends. Research findings show a strong link between human factors and the occurrence of severe injury single-vehicle crashes, as it has been observed that many of the factors associated with severe-injury outcome are driver behavior related. To illustrate the significance of the findings of this study, a third model using the combined data was developed to explore the merit of using sub-populations of the data for improved and detailed segmentation of the crash-severity factors. It has also been shown that generally, the factors that influence single-vehicle crash injury outcomes were not very different between weekdays and weekends.

A random threshold random parameters hierarchical ordered probit model is utilized to consider heterogeneity across observations. Several variables turned out to be significant in the model, including driver's education, advanced braking system deployment, presence of curves on roadways, and high speed-limit.

In India, a significant proportion of crashes are single-vehicle crashes. The vehicles which are involved in accidents due to causes such as self skidding, hitting stationary objects, trees that are simply contributed by the drivers themselves are referred to as out-of-control single-vehicle crashes. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the risk factors associated with single-vehicle motorcycle collisions in Tamilnadu, India and identifies the unique characteristics and injury outcomes associated with these collisions. Crash dataset for the present study was prepared from the police-reported crashes for the past nine years that occurred within the state of Tamilnadu between 2009 and 2017. The identified contributory factors which influence injury severity include driver characteristics, crash-related factors, traffic-related factors, vehicle and environment-related factors. In this study, injury severity is classified into three categories, i.e. fatal, serious, and minor injuries. Since the outcome of the injury severity could be measured on an ordinal scale, a discrete ordered outcome model, an ordered logit model is applied. To summarise the results, thirteen of the studied factors are found to have a significant influence on the injury severity of drivers. Results show that the likelihood of fatal injuries increases in crashes where motorcyclists hit stationary fixed objects, hit trees, ran-off road, inclement weather conditions, urban areas. It is also found that winter season, north districts of Tamilnadu, single and two-lane roads, highways, village roads and, other district roads, daylight conditions, drivers who are younger and working-age group, overtaking from left, taking u-turn are associated with less likelihood of fatal crashes. To increase the overall safety of the roads, targeted countermeasures may be designed in light of injury severity of the drivers with respect to single-vehicle crashes also.

These crashes account for more than half of all roadway fatalities in Wyoming, compared with the average of the U.S. rollover-related fatality crashes, which stands at 33%. In this study, the standard generalized linear model (GLM) was extended to the method of generalized additive model (GAM) to determine if giving more flexibility provides more realistic point estimates of the factors to the rollover crash severity. The results highlighted the superiority of the GAM compared with the GLM in terms of confusion matrix accuracy and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The results of the GAM highlighted that the majority of important factors that contribute to rollover crash severity are related to drivers’ characteristics such as driving while under influence of drugs, being under an emotional condition, driving with no valid driver license, and driving with suspended drivers’ license. Also, it was found that the impact of passenger vehicles on the severity of rollover crashes is not stable and varies based on the gender of drivers. Only two predictors were considered based on the smooth functions including posted speed limit and drivers’ age. We accounted for non-linearity of those two predictors by means of cubic spline smooth function.},

   abstract = {Objective: This study investigated the confounding effects of factors on injury outcomes for all occupants in fatal single-vehicle crashes that involved a rollover event. Method: A generalized ordered logit model was used to investigate the role of roadway attributes, environmental factors, driver characteristics, and vehicle features in injury severity outcomes for occupants. Five years of single-vehicle rollover crash data for the United States were studied. Results: Results showed that the likelihood of serious and fatal injuries increases in rollover crashes with partial or complete ejection of the occupant, no seat belt use, speeding, higher posted speed limits, roadside and median rollovers, undulating terrain, blacktop road surface, and rural roads. We also found that evening, weekdays, previous driver crash, careless or inattentive driving, driver–passenger engagement, aggressive driving, and vehicle type affect injury severity. The deployment of airbags was associated with fewer serious and fatal injuries. Regional differences were found for injury severity outcomes in rollover crashes. Conclusions: The study provides valuable insight for reducing injury severity in single-vehicle crashes where a rollover occurs. Several proven countermeasures may prevent rollovers or reduce injury severity. These strategies include increasing seatbelt use, posting lower speed limits and installing speed enforcement cameras in high-risk areas, flattening roadside embankments, and promoting in-vehicle stability enhancement systems such as electronic stability control and rollover-activated side curtain airbags.},

   abstract = {Rollover crashes are responsible for a notable number of serious injuries and fatalities; hence, they are of great concern to transportation officials and safety researchers. However, only few published studies have analyzed the factors associated with severity outcomes of rollover crashes. This research has two objectives. The first objective is to investigate the effects of various factors, of which some have been rarely reported in the existing studies, on the injury severities of single-vehicle (SV) rollover crashes based on six-year crash data collected on the Malaysian federal roads. A random-effects generalized ordered probit (REGOP) model is employed in this study to analyze injury severity patterns caused by rollover crashes. The second objective is to examine the performance of the proposed approach, REGOP, for modeling rollover injury severity outcomes. To this end, a mixed logit (MXL) model is also fitted in this study because of its popularity in injury severity modeling. Regarding the effects of the explanatory variables on the injury severity of rollover crashes, the results reveal that factors including dark without supplemental lighting, rainy weather condition, light truck vehicles (e.g., sport utility vehicles, vans), heavy vehicles (e.g., bus, truck), improper overtaking, vehicle age, traffic volume and composition, number of travel lanes, speed limit, undulating terrain, presence of central median, and unsafe roadside conditions are positively associated with more severe SV rollover crashes. On the other hand, unpaved shoulder width, area type, driver occupation, and number of access points are found as the significant variables decreasing the probability of being killed or severely injured (i.e., KSI) in rollover crashes. Land use and side friction are significant and positively associated only with slight injury category. These findings provide valuable insights into the causes and factors affecting the injury severity patterns of rollover crashes, and thus can help develop effective countermeasures to reduce the severity of rollover crashes. The model comparison results show that the REGOP model is found to outperform the MXL model in terms of goodness-of-fit measures, and also is significantly superior to other extensions of ordered probit models, including generalized ordered probit and random-effects ordered probit (REOP) models. As a result, this research introduces REGOP as a promising tool for future research focusing on crash injury severity.},

This paper presents an effort to investigate the contributing factors to large truck rollover crashes. Specific focus was placed on exploring the role of heterogeneity and the potential sources of heterogeneity regarding their impacts on injury-severity outcomes. The data used in this study contained large truck rollover crashes that occurred between 2007 and 2016 in the state of Florida. A random parameter ordered logit (RPOL) model was applied. Various driver, vehicle, roadway, and crash attributes were explored as potential predictors in the model. Their impacts were examined for the presence of heterogeneity. Interaction effects were then added to the random variables in order to detect potential sources of heterogeneity. Model results showed that the impacts of lighting conditions and driving speed had significant variation across observations, and this variation could be attributed to driver actions and driver conditions at the time of the crash, as well as driver vision obstruction. Findings from this study shed light on the direction, magnitude, and randomness of the factors that contribute to large truck rollover crashes. Findings associated with heterogeneity could help develop more effective and targeted countermeasures to improve freight safety. Driver education programs could be planned more efficiently, and advisory and warning signs could be designed in a more insightful manner by taking into account specific roadway attributes, such as sandy surfaces, downhill, curved alignment, unpaved shoulders, and lighting conditions.},

   abstract = {The study investigated factors affecting the severity of red-light-running (RLR) -related crashes by means of crash records from the State of Florida (US). Previous studies have attempted to incorporate road, driver, and environmental factors into ordinal regression models to predict the severity of crashes. However, investigating the relationship among variables can become a difficult task with traditional statistical techniques. Some explanatory variables, in fact, may impact crash severity indirectly, through one or more mediating variables (measured or unobserved). This study employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the indirect relationship between crash severity and its contributing factors. SEM is a statistical technique able to account for unobserved variables, whereas traditional severity models have focused on measured variables only. Three unobserved variables were proposed in this study to better describe the dynamic of RLR-related crashes: precrash travel speed (TS) of the bullet vehicle (at fault), the kinetic energy (KEs) applied from the bullet vehicle to the subject vehicle(s), and crash severity (overall energy resulting from a crash). A SEM model was developed to estimate the hypothesized relationships among speed, kinetic energy, and crash severity. Measured (observed) variables obtained from crash records were included in the SEM model to define latent dimensions. The results showed that crash data supported the model hypothesis and measured/unobserved variables adequately predicted crash severity. Overall, speed and kinetic energy were demonstrated to positively affect crash severity with kinetic energy being the more influential factor. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the most influential factor with respect to TS was alcohol-impaired driving conditions and the least influential was age of the at-fault driver. Regarding KEs, the number of vehicles involved in the crash showed the most influence and vehicle year was the least influential factor.},

Based on the traffic crash data for 2006–2010 in Guangdong Province, China, fixed-and random-parameter logit models are used to study the characteristics of motorcyclists, vehicles, roads, and environments involved in red light violations and injury severity resulting from motorcyclists’ running red lights in China. Certain factors that affect the probability of motorcyclists running red lights are identified. For instance, while the likelihood of violating red light signals during dark conditions is lower than during light conditions for both car drivers and pedestrians, motorcyclists have significantly increased probability of a red light violation during dark conditions. For the resulting severe casualties in red-light-running crashes, poor visibility is a common risk factor for motorcyclists and car drivers experiencing severe injury. Regarding the relationship between red light violations and the severity of injuries in crashes caused by motorcyclists running red lights, this study indicated that driving direction and time period have inconsistent effects on the probability of red light violations and the severity of injuries. On the one hand, the likelihood of red light violations when a motorcycle rider is turning left/right is higher than when going straight, but this turning factor has a nonsignificant impact on the severity of injuries; on the other hand, reversing, making a U-turn and changing lanes have nonsignificant effects on the probability of motorcyclists’ red light violations in contrast to going straight, but have a very significant impact on the severity of injuries. Moreover, the likelihood of red light violations during the early morning is higher than off-peak hours, but this time factor has a negative impact on the severity of injuries. Measures including road safety educational programs for targeted groups and focused enforcement of traffic policy and regulations are suggested to reduce the number of crashes and the severity of injuries resulting from motorcyclists running red lights.},

   abstract = {The trucking sector contributes significantly to the economic vitality of the United States. Large trucks are primarily used for transporting goods within and across states. Despite its economic importance, large truck crashes constitute public safety concerns. To minimize the consequences, there is a need to understand the factors that contribute to the severity outcomes of truck-involved crashes. Since many large truck drivers transport goods across several states, the driver-centered crash factors are expected to differ between in-state and out-of-state drivers. For this reason, this study developed two random parameters multinomial logit models with heterogeneity in means and variances to examine the factors contributing to the severity of crashes involving in-state and out-of-state large truck drivers in Alabama. The study was based on the 2016–2020 large truck crashes in Alabama. After data cleaning and preparation, it was observed that approximately 20% of in-state and 23% of out-of-state large truck crashes were fatigue-related. There were more speeding related crashes (12.4%) among in-state large truck drivers, but the contribution of speeding to crash severity outcomes was only significant in the out-of-state model. More crashes related to red light running violation (14.2%) were observed among out-of-state drivers, pointing to the fundamental issues of fatigue and unfamiliarity with the operations of signalized intersections in Alabama. The study contributes to the literature on large truck crashes by uncovering the nuances in crashes involving in-state and out-of-state large truck drivers. Despite the seeming similarity in factors that influence crash outcomes, this study provides the basis for truck drivers’ training and communication campaigns on the differences that may exist in roadway characteristics from state to state. Also, policy formulations and strategies that prioritizes the well-being of the large truck drivers and creates a better working condition for them should be explored.},

Results indicated that not using restraint systems, running a red light, wrong-way driving, failing to yield the right of way, tire or brake defects, and dark conditions had positive associations with higher levels of crash injury severity. The random variables—straight alignment, paved shoulders, and unpaved shoulders—showed significant random effects among the observations. For straight alignment, running red lights, following too closely, vision obstruction caused by fixed objects, and vision obstruction caused by fog were the sources of heterogeneity. Unpaved shoulders, running red lights, wrong-way driving, and the presence of parked or stopped vehicles were found as interaction effects. Results showed that accounting for heterogeneity and interaction effects significantly improved the goodness of fit of the model.

A series of likelihood ratio tests are conducted to examine the temporal stability of factors across different studied years. The marginal effects of factors in different injury-severity models are compared. Significant temporal instability is found among the studied year periods. The threshold value estimated using the random threshold random parameters HOPIT model is found to be random parameters and determined by specific explanatory variables.

A roadway departure crash severity model is developed using binary logit model, and statistical proportion tests are conducted to compare roadway departure crash severity with and without guardrail hits. Both methods suggest that hitting guardrail could reduce the probability of fatal and severe injury by about 45% to 50% and that the reduction is statistically significant. A unique approach of this article is to pair each roadway departure crash hitting a guardrail with the corresponding guardrail inventory using advanced spatial analysis technique so that the effects of different guardrail types on crash severity can be explored.

Moreover, Maine has aging infrastructure, houses the oldest population in the United States, and experiences the third coldest weather in the United States. Methods: This study analyzes the impact of roadway, driver, and weather factors on the severity of single-vehicle lane departure crashes occurring from 2017 to 2019 on rural roadways in Maine. Rather than using police reported weather, weather station data were utilized. Four facility types: Interstates, minor arterials, major collectors, and minor collectors were considered for analysis. The Multinomial Logistic Regression model was used for the analysis. The property damage only (PDO) outcome was considered as the reference (or base) category. Results: The modeling results show that the odds of a crash leading to major injury or fatality (KA outcome) increases by 330%, 150%, 243%, and 266% for older drivers (65 or above) compared to young drivers (29 or less) on Interstates, minor arterials, major collectors, and minor collectors, respectively. During the winter period (October to April), the odds of KA severity outcome (with respect to the PDO) decreases by 65%, 65%, 65%, and 48% on Interstates, minor arterials, major collectors, and minor collectors, respectively, presumably due to reduced speeds during winter weather events. Conclusion: In Maine, factors such as older drivers, operating under the influence, speeding, precipitation, and not wearing a seatbelt showed higher odds of leading to injury. Practical Applications: This study provides safety analysts and practitioners in Maine a comprehensive study of factors that influence the severity of crashes in Maine at different facilities to improve maintenance strategies, enhance safety using proper safety countermeasures, or increase awareness across the state.},

Besides their devastating impact on roadway users, traffic crashes lead to substantial economic losses on both personal and societal levels. Due to the complexity of crash events and the unique conditions in each country and state, empirical local calibration for the correlation between attributes of interest and the safety performance is always recommended. Limited studies have established a procedure to analyze the impact of pavement condition on traffic safety in a risk analysis scheme. This study presents a thorough analysis of some roadway departure crashes which occurred in Iowa between 2006 and 2016. All crash records were mapped onto one-mile segments with known traffic volume (i.e., AADT), posted speed limits (SL), skid numbers (SN), ride qualities (IRI), and rut depths (RD) in a geographic information system (GIS) database. The crash records were correlated to the pavement surface condition (i.e., SN, IRI, and RD) using negative binomial regression models. Moreover, a novel risk analysis framework is introduced to perform crash risk assessment and evaluate the possible consequences for a given combination of events. The analysis shows a significant impact of pavement skid resistance on roadway-departure crashes under all accident conditions and severities. Risk analysis will facilitate coordination between the pavement management system and safety management system in the future, which will help with optimizing the overall highway network performance.},

The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between injury severity and characteristics of the crash and the cyclist with focus on SBCs. Furthermore, injury risk is calculated for different age classes and sexes, as well as for different purposes of the trip.

Binary logistic regression was applied to analyse how the odds of being severely injured differed for different cyclists and situations. Results from of the National Travel Survey, 2011–2016, were used to study differences in distance travelled with respect to sex, age group and purpose of the trip. Given that the cyclist is injured in an SBC, the results show a higher probability of being severely injured (maximal AIS 3 or more) for cyclists 45 years or older compared to younger cyclists, for males compared to females and for cyclists not wearing a helmet compared to cyclists wearing a helmet. A higher probability for severe injury was also found for crashes occurring during leisure trips compared to work/school trips, crashes occurring during weekdays compared to weekends and crashes at intersections and road stretches compared to pedestrian and cycle paths. Furthermore, the risk of being severely injured in an SBC per km travelled was higher for cyclists aged 45 and older and during a leisure trip.},

   abstract = {Objective: Urban and transport planners worldwide have recently designed and implemented policies for increasing the number of cyclists. Although cycling is on the rise even in car-oriented cities and regions, the fear of being involved in a crash is still the main obstacle to further increases in cycling market shares. The current study proposes the first joint model of frequency and severity of cyclist–motorist collisions with the aim of unraveling the factors contributing to both the probability of being involved in a crash and, conditional on the crash occurrence, experiencing a severe injury outcome. Method: A multivariate Poisson-lognormal model with correlated autoregressive priors was estimated on a sample of 5,349 cyclist–motorist crashes that occurred in the Copenhagen region between 2009 and 2013. The model considered the links of the road network in the region as the unit of observation, controlled for traffic exposure of nonmotorized and motorized transport modes, evaluated the effect of infrastructure and land use, and accounted for heterogeneity and spatial correlation across links. Results: Results confirmed the existence of the phenomenon of safety in numbers and added to the narrative by emphasizing that the most severe crashes are the ones most benefiting from an increase in the number of cyclists. In addition, results argued that the construction of Copenhagen-style bicycle paths would significantly contribute to increasing safety, especially in suburban areas where the speed differential between cyclists and motorists is greater. Last, results illustrated a need for thinking about cycling safety in intersection design and reflecting on the importance of spatial and aspatial correlation both within and between injury categories. Conclusions: The findings from this study illustrated how encouraging cycling would increase safety in relation to the phenomenon of safety in numbers and how, in turn, increasing safety would convince more people to cycle. In addition, they suggested how the design of bicycle infrastructure should not only consider bicycle lanes but in particular focus on bicycle paths where the number of conflicts and the stress for sharing the road are highly reduced and how thinking about road design should extend to the general level and include a discourse about safer intersections. Last, attention should be given to the road design in the city center and to traffic management, because clearly safer traffic implies more cyclists and, in turn, more cyclists imply fewer cars and less congestion.},

Logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify predictors of severe injury (serious injury and fatality) in cyclist crashes reported to the police. There were 6432 cyclist crashes reported to the police in Victoria between 2004 and 2008 with 2181 (33.9%) resulting in severe injury of the cyclist involved. The multivariate analysis found that factors that increase the risk of severe injury in cyclists involved in traffic crashes were age (50 years and older), not wearing a helmet, riding in the dark on unlit roads, riding on roads zoned 70 km/h or above, on curved sections of the road, in rural locations and being involved in head-on collisions as well as off path crashes, which include losing control of vehicle, and on path crashes which include striking the door of a parked vehicle. While this study did not test effectiveness of preventative measures, policy makers should consider implementation of programs that address these risk factors including helmet programs and environmental modifications such as speed reduction on roads that are frequented by cyclists. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, few research efforts have been made to examine and compare different contributing factors to cyclist injury severity at such locations. Therefore, this study aims to identify and analyze the impact of various factors on cyclist injury severity at intersection and nonintersection locations. Police-reported data from 2007 to 2014 in North Carolina are used in this study. Three mixed-logit models are developed based on the preestimated multinomial logit models. Market segmentation is conducted to analyze cyclist injury severity at separate locations. An ordered probit model is also developed and compared with the mixed-logit model at both locations. Furthermore, cyclists drinking alcohol; driving van, bus, or single-unit truck; motorists’ fault; inclement weather; dusk or dawn are found to have a significant impact on cyclist injury severity at intersections. Cyclist gender, drivers drinking alcohol, vehicle speed, speeding, rural or urban areas, traffic control, curved road are found to have a significant impact at nonintersection locations.},

As an active transport mode, the act of walking is sensitive to changes in weather conditions. However, comprehensive real-time weather data are often unavailable for road safety analysis. In this study, we used a geographical information system approach to integrate high-resolution weather data, as well as their corresponding temporal and spatial distributions, with crash data. Then, we established a mixed logit model to determine the association between pedestrian crash severity and possible risk factors. The results indicate that high temperature and the presence of rain were associated with a higher likelihood of Killed and Severe Injury (KSI) crashes. Also, we found the interaction effects of weather condition (hot weather and presence of rain) on the association between pedestrian crash severity and pedestrian and driver behaviors to be significant. For instance, the effects of jaywalking and risky driving behavior on crash severity were more prevalent under rainy conditions. In addition, the effects of driver inattention and reckless crossing were more significant in hot weather conditions. This has critical policy implications for the development and implementation of proactive traffic management systems. For instance, real-time weather and traffic data should be incorporated into dynamic message signs and in-vehicle warning systems. Doing so will enhance the levels of safety awareness of drivers and pedestrians, especially in adverse weather conditions. As a result, pedestrian safety can be improved over the long term.},

   abstract = {Introduction: The high percentage of fatalities in pedestrian-involved crashes is a critical social problem. The purpose of this study is to investigate factors influencing injury severity in pedestrian crashes by examining the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the regions where crashes occurred. Method: To understand the correlation between the unobserved characteristics of pedestrian crashes in a defined region, we apply a hierarchical ordered model, in which we set crash characteristics as lower-level variables and municipality characteristics as upper-level. Pedestrian crash data were collected and analyzed for a three-year period from 2011 to 2013. The estimation results show the statistically significant factors that increase injury severity of pedestrian crashes. Results: At the crash level, the factors associated with increased severity of pedestrian injury include intoxicated drivers, road-crossing pedestrians, elderly pedestrians, heavy vehicles, wide roads, darkness, and fog. At the municipality level, municipalities with low population density, lower level of financial independence, fewer doctors, and a higher percentage of elderly residents experience more severe pedestrian crashes. Municipalities ranked as having the top 10% pedestrian fatality rate (fatalities per 100,000 residents) have rates 7.4 times higher than municipalities with the lowest 10% rate of fatalities. Their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics also have significant differences. The proposed model accounts for a 7% unexplained variation in injury severity outcomes between the municipalities where crashes occurred. Conclusion: To enhance the safety of vulnerable pedestrians, considerable investments of time and effort in pedestrian safety facilities and zones should be made. More certain and severe punishments should be also given for the traffic violations that increase injury severity of pedestrian crashes. Furthermore, central and local governments should play a cooperative role to reduce pedestrian fatalities. Practical applications: Based on our study results, we suggest policy directions to enhance pedestrian safety.},

Therefore, this study aimed to identify the contributing environmental, road, and vehicular factors that influenced pedestrian—single-vehicle crash severity in Dhaka, a megacity and the capital of Bangladesh. A binary logistic regression model was developed in this study by analyzing a data set of pedestrian—single-vehicle crashes involving casualties in Dhaka from 2010 to 2015. The model identified seven significant factors influencing pedestrian-vehicle crash severity. Significant factors increasing the likelihood of fatal crashes included crashes during adverse weather, dawn/dusk period, night period (where street light was absent), off-peak period, crashes where road divider was unavailable, road geometry was straight and flat, and crashes those were occurred by heavier vehicles. Besides, crashes at three-legged intersections were less likely to be fatal. Both similarities and differences were found among the significant factors influencing pedestrian-vehicle crash severity in Dhaka from the findings of the developed countries. The findings of this study would help transport engineers and planners to design safer roadways for both pedestrians and vehicles.},

To reduce the injuries of bus-pedestrian crashes, we recommend improving the light conditions, reducing the jaywalking behaviour of pedestrians, implementing speed bumps in high speed zones and installing pedestrian detection systems on buses. 13 years of bus-pedestrian crashes in Victoria, Australia was analyzed. Association rules discovery was used for modeling pedestrian fatality. Darkness, pedestrian movement, zone speed and age effect the rate of fatality.

This study attempted to develop pedestrian crash frequency and severity models on national roads by using the road characteristics and built environment parameters, based on the road crash data (2016–2018) that involved pedestrians in Metro Manila, Philippines. Remarkable findings included primary roads, presence of footbridges, road sections with bad surface conditions, and increased fractions of commercial, residential, and industrial roads, which exhibited a greater likelihood of pedestrian crashes. Crashes involving elderly pedestrians, heavier vehicles, late-night hours, fair surface conditions, and open spaces were associated with increased likelihoods of fatal outcomes. Essentially, this study provides a macroscopic perspective in understanding the factors associated with the severity and frequency of pedestrian crashes, and it would aid the authorities in identifying proper countermeasures.},

First, a GIS kernel density technique was used to identify spatial clusters with high concentrations of pedestrian crash fatalities and severe injuries. Subsequently, partial proportional odds models were developed using the crash dataset for the whole city and the identified spatial clusters to examine and compare the risk factors that significantly affect pedestrian crash injury severity. The model results reveal higher increases in the fatality probability within the spatial clusters for statistically significant contributing factors related to drunk driving, traffic signage disobedience, and imprudence of the pedestrian. The findings may be utilized in the development and implementation of effective public policies and preventive measures to help improve pedestrian safety in Santiago.},

Researchers have studied the relationships between motorcycle crash severity and crash contributing factors. They are crash characteristics, roadway geometric design features, traffic characteristics, socio-demographics and environmental conditions. However, few researchers considered unobserved heterogeneity effects when modeling motorcycle crash injury severities, let alone interaction effects. In this research, motorcycle crashes in Wyoming that occurred from 2008 to 2017 were analyzed. Specifically, the injury severities of single motorcycle crashes and multiple vehicle crashes involving motorcycles were modeled. The response was whether the motorcycle crash incurred an incapacitating injury or fatality or not. The binary logistic regression and mixed binary logistic regression modeling structures were implemented. The mixed models revealed effects that otherwise would have been undisclosed in the binary logistic regression models’ results. According to the results of single motorcycle crashes, the majority of motorcycle-animal crashes and of motorcycle-barrier crashes were likely to be severe relative to other single motorcycle crashes. It was also found that horizontal curves increased the risk of severe injuries. Young riders were found to be less at risk of being gravely injured in single motorcycle crashes than older riders as well. Furthermore, riding under the influence and high posted speed limits increased the odds of severe crashes regardless of whether the crashes were single motorcycle crashes or multiple vehicle crashes involving motorcycles. Additionally, the mixed models uncovered interaction effects and unobserved effects pertaining to speed limits.},

A Bayesian Multinomial Logit Model with a Dirichlet random effect parameter was used to analyze four years (2013–2016) of crash data. The main benefit of this model is that it accounts for the groups of unobserved heterogeneity that exists in the data. The response variable is injury severity with three categories: fatal/severe injury, minor injury, and possible/no injury. The potential variables affecting motorcycle crashes were grouped into four categories: human, environment, roadway, and crash. Relative risk ratios and average pseudoelasticity were obtained to identify the factors influencing the severity of motorcycles crashes. The model results suggested that the following factors increase the probability of fatal/severe injury crashes: speeding, violations, head-on collisions, weekend, and off-peak hours. Several countermeasures were recommended based on the study findings. These countermeasures propose holistic safety improvement strategies encompassing the three E’s of highway safety, namely Engineering, Education, and Enforcement.},

Before conducting any analysis, feature reduction was performed to identify the optimal number of variables to include in the models by minimizing the error rate. Different metrics including the area under the curve and confusion matrix were used to compare the different models. Although the analyses were conducted on a relatively small dataset, the results indicate that almost all the DNN models better perform in predicting the severity of motorcycle crashes, compared with the single layer neural network. Finally, the RNN outperforms the other three neural network models. A comprehensive discussion has been made about the methodological approach implemented in this study.},

Although motorcycles play a crucial role in improving mobility in the city, they have several safety issues. This study focuses on identifying factors influencing the severity of motorcycle crashes. Method: A multinomial logit analysis was conducted to identify factors influencing the severity of motorcycle crashes in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The severity categories were fatal, severe injury, minor injury, and property damage only (PDO). The analysis was based on a total of 784 motorcycle crashes that occurred from 2013 to 2016. Results: The following factors were found to increase the probability of a fatality: Speeding, driving under the influence, head-on impact, presence of horizontal curves, reckless riding, off-peak hours, violations, and riding without a helmet. The results indicate that crashes occurring on weekdays, during peak hours, at intersections, involving a rear-end impact, in daylight, on street roads, and under clear weather conditions decrease the probability of a fatality. However, minor injury and PDO crashes were found to be associated with crashes occurring during peak hours, at intersections, and on street roads, as well as failure to yield right-of-way.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of motorcycle crash data between 2011 and 2015 was conducted using a motorcycle crash data set extracted from the National Road Traffic Crash Database at the Building and Road Research Institute (BRRI) in Ghana. Injury severity was classified into 4 categories: Fatal, hospitalized, injured, and damage only. A multinomial logit modeling framework was used to identify the possible determinants of motorcycle crash severity. Results: During the study period, a total of 8,516 motorcycle crashes were recorded, of which 22.9% were classified as fatal, 42.1% were classified as hospitalized injuries, 29.4% were classified as slight injuries, and 5.6% were classified as damage-only crashes. The estimation results indicate that the following factors increase the probability of fatal injuries: At a junction; weekend; signage; poor road shoulder; village settlement; tarred and good road surface; and collision between motorcycle and heavy goods vehicle (HGV). Motorcycle crashes occurring during the daytime and on the weekend increases the probability of hospitalized injury. The results also suggest that motorcycle crashes occurring during the daytime, in curves or inclined portions of roads, or in unclear weather conditions decrease the probability of fatal injury. Conclusions: This study provides further empirical evidence to support motorcycle crash modeling research, which is lacking in developing countries. The ability to understand the various factors that influence motorcycle crash severity is a step forward in providing an appropriate basis upon which informed motorcycle crash policies can be developed. Particular attention should be given to the provision of road signage at junctions and speed humps and controlling traffic during the weekend.

Data obtained from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System in 2019, are used to calibrate the model. The results indicate that the number of vehicles involved in the crash, collision manner, truck-airbag deployment, overturn of vehicles, driver's speeding offense, and gross vehicle weight are the key determinants of crash injury severity. Uni- and two-dimensional inference analyses were conducted to determine the relations among these factors and their association with crash severity.},

   abstract = {In the past, many attempts have been made to study the effects of large trucks on the safety of roadway users. However, the exact effects of weekdays and weekends on the injury-severity of these types of crashes are lacking. In this study, crash data from Los Angeles was used to investigate the transferability of the large-truck crash injury-severity determinants across weekdays and weekends. Crash-injury severities were estimated using random parameters logit models while considering three categories of injury-severity levels. The model estimation was done by considering several parameters that could potentially affect the crash injury severities such as truck's characteristics, drivers’ attributes, driver actions, weather conditions, crash time, and roadway attributes. The transferability of the model estimation results across weekdays and weekends was assessed using likelihood ratio tests. Moreover, the stability of the explanatory variables was investigated using the calculated marginal effects. With a high confidence level, the estimation results disclose that weekday/weekend must be modeled separately as the contributing factors to each model are different. Still, some factors such as young drivers, at fault drivers, rear-end crashes, colliding fixed objects, intersection related crashes, and crash time are affecting injury severity in both models. The findings of this research could be used by trucking companies and decision makers to better regulate the traffic or trucking rules for weekdays and weekends.},

   abstract = {Teen drivers remain one of the most long-standing traffic safety concerns, as they continue to be overrepresented in the fatal and injury crash statistics. No previous studies have explored significant variations in the effect of risk attributes contributing to teen driver collisions in multiple crash circumstances by degrees of crash severity. Therefore, substantial exploration of teen driver crashes is expected to facilitate the strategic employment of countermeasures effectively. This study aimed to analyze teen driver crashes to investigate the heterogeneous effect of contributing factors on crash severity outcomes. Three years (2017 to 2019) of police-investigated crash information was used for the state of Alabama. This research first applied latent class clustering to minimize the heterogeneity in the extracted dataset by dividing the data into meaningful clusters (subgroups of the whole data). Then, multinomial logit models were constructed to illustrate the significant risk factors influencing the severity outcomes in different crash scenarios. Marginal effects were computed to understand the impacts of variable categories better. The findings suggested that the significance and estimated impact of variables varied within clusters and between crash severity levels in the same cluster. The results of latent class segmented submodels represented real-world crash patterns demonstrating the cumulative effect of variable attributes. Such contextual understandings of underlying risk factors could help to strengthen existing teen driver educational interventions. In addition, the study outcomes could assist practitioners and policy makers in developing safety improvement strategies to reduce the causalities associated with teen driver crashes in distinct circumstances.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This study examines the relative risk of death among crash-involved teenage drivers in relation to the number and ages of passengers present. Methods: We performed cross-sectional analysis of police-reported crashes in the United States in years 2016–2019 to estimate rate ratios for death among drivers aged 16–17 years by passenger composition (no passengers, one teen, ≥two teens, teens and adults aged 20–34 years, adults aged 20–34 years only, ≥one adult aged 35–64 years). Models were adjusted for confounding and effect modification related to driver, crash, and environmental factors. Results: Crash-involved teen drivers carrying ≥2 teen passengers were twice as likely to die as teens driving alone. The driver was seven times as likely to die when carrying a mix of teen and young adult passengers compared with teens driving alone. Teen drivers' risk of death was lowest in the presence of an adult passenger aged 35–64 years. Carrying one teen passenger presents greater risk of death than driving alone for male teen drivers but not for females. Discussion: When teen drivers crash, they are more likely to die if they are carrying teen and/or young adult passengers than if they are driving alone or with a mature adult. The results support the current graduated licensing policies restricting young novice drivers from carrying teenage passengers. Results also help to clarify why previous studies have found that young passengers are associated with increased risk of fatal crashes, but not nonfatal crashes: it appears that passengers may have an effect on crash severity.},

   abstract = {Road traffic crashes have increased over the years leading to greater injury severity among children who are mostly vehicle occupants in high-income countries. This adversely affects the healthy development of children and might lead to death. However, studies in the literature have focused on predicting crash injuries among adults while children have different crash injury risks as well as crash kinematics compared to adults. To address this gap, this paper presents a new dataset for child occupant crash injury severity prediction collected over 8 years (2012 to 2019) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The performance of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms was then evaluated using the proposed dataset. In addition, feature selection techniques and logistic regression model were employed to extract the most significant features for crash injury severity prediction among child occupants. Furthermore, the impact of data balancing approaches on the prediction performance was analyzed as the dataset is highly imbalanced. The experimental results showed that Adaboost, Bagging REP, ZeroR, OneR, and Decision Table algorithms predicts child occupant injury severity with the highest accuracy. Child occupant seating position, emirate, crash location, crash type and crash cause were observed as significant features that predicts injury severity by both the feature selection and logistic regression models.},

   abstract = {Despite the efforts in the literature review on the traffic safety of children, the majority of past studies mainly focused only on the child’s seatbelt status, or its position while ignoring other underlying factors that might contribute to the severity of those crashes. Inclusion of ther factors is especially important for a mountainous state like Wyoming with one of the highest rates of children’s traffic fatality in the country. Thus, this study is conducted to fill the gap by identifying important factors contributing to the severity of crashes involving children. Here child is defined as any passengers under 9 years old. A first step in identifying factors to the severity of crashes involving children is implementing a reliable statistical method that could account for heterogeneity across various observations. So, in this study, to account for the heterogeneity in the dataset, the standard cumulative link model (CLM) was extended to the random effect model, while instead of assigning the subjective attribute for random effect, an objective hierarchy through the finite mixture modeling (FMM) was used. The FMM was employed in the context of the CLM to prevent the loss of information due to disaggregation of the dataset into the homogeneous datasets. The comparison results highlighted that the random effect model by the objective hierarchy would result in a significant improvement in the model fit compared with the standard cumulative link model. The results highlighted factors such as safety equipment in use, type of collision, and various drivers’ characteristics and actions such as belting condition, alcohol and drug involvement are some of the factors contributing to the severity of child crashes. As expected, the main findings of our results highlighted that various drivers’ actions and behaviors are the main causes that children would undergo a higher severity level in crashes. An extensive discussion regarding the implications of the results and the implemented statistical method were given in the context of the manuscript.},

   abstract = {Objective To investigate the risk and injury severity on the regional body (head, neck, and chest) of obese children in frontal motor vehicle crashes (MVCs). Methods No physical surrogates (i.e., crash dummies) for obese children were available, and experiments on pediatric cadavers were generally not feasible. Therefore, computational models of obese children using medical imaging processing and state-of-the-art modeling techniques were developed. A hybrid modeling technique was used to integrate the finite element model for torso fat layer into the standard multibody model to represent various levels of obese children for 3-and 6-year-old age groups. The models were used to investigate injury severity under various crash scenarios through model simulations. Results The head injury criterion and chest acceleration were observed to increase as body mass index (BMI) increased. Meanwhile, no such correlations were found between BMI and neck injury and chest deformation. Forward head and torso excursions were observed to increase as obesity increased, owing to the momentum effect of greater body mass. Conclusions Obese children appeared to have greater risks for head and chest injuries than do their non-obese counterparts in frontal MVCs, owing to higher head and chest accelerations induced by greater body excursion.},

   abstract = {Objective Describe age-based urban pedestrian versus auto crash characteristics and identify crash characteristics associated with injury severity. Materials and methods Secondary analysis of the 2004-2010 National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration database for Illinois. All persons in Chicago crashes with age data who were listed as pedestrians (n = 7175 child age ≤ 19 yo, n = 16,398 adult age ≥ 20 yo) were included. Incidence and crash characteristics were analyzed by age groups and year. Main outcome measures were incidence, crash setting, and injury severity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate injury severity by crash characteristics. Results Overall incidence was higher for child (146.6 per 100,000) versus adult (117.3 per 100,000) pedestrians but case fatality rate was lower (0.7% for children, 1.7% for adults). Child but not adult pedestrian injury incidence declined over time (trend test p < 0.0001 for <5 yo, 5-9 yo, and 10-14 yo; p < 0.05 for 15-19 yo, p = 0.96 for ≥ 20 yo). Most crashes for both children and adults took place during optimal driving conditions. Injuries were more frequent during warmer months for younger age groups compared to older (χ;bsupesup p< 0.001). Midblock crashes increased as age decreased (p < 0.0001 for trend). Most crashes occurred at sites with sub-optimal traffic controls but varied by age (p < 0.0001 for trend). Crashes were more likely to be during daylight on dry roads in clear weather conditions for younger age groups compared to older (χ;bsupesup p < 0.001). Daylight was associated with less severe injury (child OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-0.98; adult OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.87-0.93). Conclusion The incidence of urban pedestrian crashes declined over time for child subgroups but not for adults. The setting of pedestrian crashes in Chicago today varies by age but is similar to that seen in other urban locales previously. Injuries for all age groups tend to be less severe during daylight conditions. Age-based prevention efforts may prove beneficial.},
