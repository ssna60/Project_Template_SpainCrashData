The aim of the research here is to present a machine learning model to predict the severity of accidents with Spanish accident data. We consider the response variable as the severity of accidents in two levels of injury or non-injury accident. Obviously, a fatal accident is included in the group of injury accidents. The research method is as follows:

1.  First, the accident data of Spain is loaded

2.  Through exploratory analysis, the data is checked and some graphs are drawn

3.  Some variables are selected as predictive variables. In this case, only previous experiences are used and special feature engineering is not used

4.  A decision tree machine learning model is built

5.  With cross-validation, the built model is checked and then finalized 6

6.  The final model is evaluated
